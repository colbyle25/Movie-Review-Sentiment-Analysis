8/10,"A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one.",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Murphy is exceptional,07 2023,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."
7/10,Quality but exhausting,07 2023,I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.
10/10,A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws."
10/10,Nolan delivers a powerfull biopic that shows the dark side of human nature!,07 2023,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!"
8/10,"Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,A Masterpiece,07 2023,I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.
10/10,And the Oscar goes to...,07 2023,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar."
8/10,Is it just me ?,07 2023,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8."

10/10,Another Cinematic Masterpiece by Christopher Nolan,07 2023,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time."
6/10,This just might be as interesting as this topic can get,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
4/10,Disappointing,07 2023,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film."
9/10,Exceptional storytelling and Genius Cinametography,07 2023,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."
8/10,This movie is the bomb!,07 2023,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure."
8/10,Technically superb but...,07 2023,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable."
8/10,"Murphy is Amazing, But Downey Jr Steals The Show",07 2023,I just got out of Oppenheimer
10/10,FUTURE CLASSIC and EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MOVIE FOR THE PRESENT DAY,07 2023,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!"
10/10,Stunning - put it in a time capsule,07 2023,My Review - Oppenheimer My Rating Ten plus 10/10 In Cinemas now
6/10,Too loud and too long,08 2023,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime."
8/10,"Good movie, but don't let Nolan fans fool you.",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
6/10,"Half an Hour too long, misses the point",07 2023,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up."
4/10,no amount of dramatic music or quick cuts could convince me I was being entertained,08 2023,"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all."
10/10,Simply amazing,07 2023,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade."
9/10,The cinematic event of 2023.,08 2023,"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat."

10/10,A sheer Brilliance of Christopher Nolan,07 2023,Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer the creator of Atomic Bomb and his role in Manhattan Project in R&D for Nuclear weapon. The movie is the Biography of Dr. Oppenheimer.
7/10,I Wish I Could Say I Had A Blast,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Cinematic masterpiece,07 2023,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before."
5/10,An unpopular opinion from a die-hard Nolan fan,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius."
9/10,superior filmmaking and historical storytelling,07 2023,"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening."
9/10,Nolan at his best!,07 2023,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator."
8/10,Fission. Fusion. Oscars.,07 2023,"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised."
8/10,When Particle Worlds Collide...,07 2023,"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations."
8/10,Mini serie would have been a better way to go,07 2023,"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet."
6/10,Quite boring,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Do the means justify the end?,07 2023,"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home."
6/10,"No doubt a well made story, but overall, was just boring",08 2023,"Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic."
4/10,Pearls before swine,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,A staggering achievement,08 2023,"I'm a Nolan fanboy, but I'll be honest, I was not terribly excited for this film. An extremely long, talky drama about a historical event didn't seem up my alley, but man was I glued to the screen for the entire 3 hour experience. Nolan has mastered the skill of heavy dialogue with quick cuts to keep things moving and engaging. He lets the little moments breathe too, it's not all breakneck speed. This balance makes for a highly enjoyable viewing experience."
10/10,Nolan's best so far?,07 2023,"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender."

9/10,People Who Change The World Like Oppenheimer Can't Not Be Complicated,07 2023,"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like."

10/10,They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far.,07 2023,"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values)."
6/10,"""Property is Theft""... Are you kidding me?",07 2023,"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb."
9/10,"Great, epic and unique biopic but not for everyone",07 2023,Greetings from Lithuania.
6/10,"Strong middle, first and third acts are a bore",07 2023,"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about."
5/10,"A cold, long history lesson",07 2023,"Oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. First, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. And second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. Having watched the film, I can confidently say none of those promises are true."

9/10,"A Long Slog Through History, But Blows Up The Quality Of the Genre",07 2023,LIKES:
10/10,I'll Bet That's Jack Quaid As Richard Feynman Playing The Bongo Drum,07 2023,"I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. Covering almost forty years, from Oppenheimer as a student in England and Germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, Nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than I can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. And like watching Penn & Teller do the cup-and-ball trick, I see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than I recognized Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece."
7/10,Mixed feelings,07 2023,"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie."

8/10,"An important movie, I liked a lot in it.",07 2023,"Will some think this is boring? For sure. Will some think it's too long? Undoubtedly. But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been. This is good and informative 20th century history!"
8/10,Misconceptions blown away. A film deserving of the long running time.,08 2023,"I admit to having some misconceptions about viewing this film at the cinema, in IMAX because of its subject matter and running time."
10/10,Fabulous but not for everyone,08 2023,"I am definitely a Christopher Nolan fan and loved it but if you like action this isn't the film for you. This is quite a cerebral film, you need to pay attention to what's being said. There's a lot of talking, a lot of jumping back and forth, you need your brain switched on. It reminds me a lot of JFK actually."

10/10,The greatness of Nolan's work,07 2023,"The cinematic genius Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the finest stars in the film industry. With his unique talent and boundless creativity, he has crafted a new cinematic icon (Oppenheimer) that will undoubtedly be immortalized in the world of cinema. It will stand among the greatest works ever seen in the realm of cinema because Nolan only delivers iconic masterpieces."
7/10,Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype,07 2023,"I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me."

3/10,Boring and without science,07 2023,First of all- they left out the science and the interesting problem solving when inventing the a-bomb.
10/10,A Film for the big screen,07 2023,"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details."
9/10,Gonna win a ton of awards next spring,07 2023,"Clear your shelves, Christopher Nolan and many of those involved in the making of his new movie OPPENHEIMER, you're going to need the space for the many, many trophies you are going to receive next spring."
6/10,Movie which was not required,07 2023,"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event."
6/10,Non-stop background music ruins it,07 2023,I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.

10/10,An absolute must see,07 2023,"Oppenheimer (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters tonight. The storyline follows a Princeton professor who is teaching a theory on a radical new science during World War II. The Germans and Japan are winning the war, and the arms race to build the next great bomb could tip the outcome. The scientist is asked to help the United States military create a bomb that could end the war. He will need to deal with the ethical aspects before, during and after the creation of the ask, as well as manage his personal life and political pressures."
10/10,An astonishing accomplichment,07 2023,This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.
10/10,A brilliant masterpiece that cuts to the core of human fear,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."
6/10,Unnecessarily lengthy,07 2023,"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck."

4/10,Just not good.,07 2023,"I'm a huge Nolan fan since his first film. My favorite is still Memento, which is thorough and slow and very dialogue heavy as well as philosophical. I have a friend who works in Los Alamos as a chemical engineer and have visited the area as well as heard plenty about Oppenheimer and the way he changed the world. The importance of scientists and especially theoretical physicists is not lost on me. Between all that and my love for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, I'd been looking forward to this movie for a long time."

10/10,Mr. Nolan is an amazing legend,07 2023,"Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness."

2/10,A highly overrated film with an obnoxiously loud soundtrack,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,A Very Nolan Film,08 2023,"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart."
6/10,Disappointing Nolan,07 2023,"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement."
6/10,Almost Walked Out,07 2023,"The love for this movie is very perplexing. I keep reading words like ""masterpiece"" to describe it and I just don't see it. What I saw was a disjointed mess! No character development and very poor story telling. I suppose its erratic quality was intentional on the part or the director (perhaps to help us into the mind of Oppenheimer), but it most certainly didn't land for me. I checked the clock a lot. Had I been watching it on streaming, I'd probably have turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so."
5/10,Disappointed,07 2023,"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end."
10/10,Nolan has truly outdone himself,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real."
7/10,Story about a security clearance,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
5/10,Too long and too little to draw interest.,07 2023,"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher."
10/10,Peak Cinema!,07 2023,"Oppenheimer isn't a biopic, it's a journey of questions through the eyes of one person, Nolan delivered an intellectual dilemma that leaves you thinking for a long time."
10/10,An awe-inspiring theatrical experience!,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a biopic of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer(Cillian Murphy). Dr. Oppenheimer faces all kinds of hurdles, both internal & external, during his crucial role in developing the atomic bomb, during World War II."
10/10,One of the great pieces of cinema of our time,07 2023,I went in with very high expectations and somehow left being more blown away than I thought possible .
6/10,Overhyped,07 2023,"The world has been waiting for a first class drama to help bring em back to the movies after a shortage of really fine movies for a really long time. I went in hoping that this was gonna be the cinematic miracle that Hollywood has been holding it's breath for. It wasn't. It was a modestly adequate film that I could have skipped. With a running time of close to three hours, this ponderous film just felt repetitive and quite tedious throughout. There's an all star cast that would have been better served by appearing in a movie that had been written and edited with more selectivity. Had I seen it on TV and it had been a half hour shorter, perhaps I'd have thought more of it."
7/10,"Very Good; Technically Great, but Emotionally Lands Just Short of a Classic",08 2023,"Acting was about as perfect as you can get from the leads, directing was at times brilliant and other times superfluous, editing was timejumpy but made it compelling, seeing Einy was magical, ending was solid, writing was dialogue driven, the best scene was addressing the audience after the event."
8/10,Captivating Drama with strong performances,07 2023,"The captivating drama was carried away by supremely talented actors, with Cilian Murphy skillfully portraying the complex character of J. Robert Oppenheimer. After a long hiatus, RDJ (Acting POV) finally gets the recognition he deserves. The background music (BGM) is extraordinary, and the cinematography is exhilarating. Although I haven't read Kai Bird's ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" yet, I have watched NBC's latest documentary titled ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb,"" which is more convenient to grasp as a whole. However, Nolan's portrayal of Oppenheimer was superior from an subjective point of view."
10/10,"Epic, mature spectacle",07 2023,"Oppenheimer tracks one of the most important and terrifying events in the history of the world in epic fashion, creating a mature spectacle on a scale that's unheard of and feels like the culmination of all of Christopher Nolan's preoccupations whilst still breaking new ground. It's a sobering look at our impending doom."
8/10,"A decent experience, still not perfect",07 2023,"The film's abundance of characters, combined with its non-linear narrative approach, might leave you a bit puzzled during your first viewing."
10/10,"Absorbing, Extremely Well-Acted, and a Fascinating Subject",07 2023,"It's gratifying to know that in a supposedly ""dumbed down"" America, a three-hour docudrama about a theoretical physicist and his atomic ""project,"" along with a closed-door security clearance hearing and an open Senate confirmation hearing, both full of dialogue and minimal ""action,"" is generating a huge, but deservedly so, box office. I found this film mesmerizing as the three hours seem to fly by for me. It has a very intelligent script, some masterful acting, and a focus on a fascinating, if enigmatic, character, i.e., Oppenheimer. The ""father"" of the atomic bomb was, indeed, a genius and generous-minded (on occasion), but also exhibited character flaws, and for such an adept administrator was also politically naïve."

7/10,Story doesn't fit the form,07 2023,I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.
8/10,"Marvellous and will win all the Oscars, but a challenging watch",07 2023,"As expected this is a fantastic movie. Oppenheimer contain some of the best acting ever seen and the directing is simply amazing. The music score is stunning, the story brilliantly told, and there are barely any flaws. This is intelligent filmmaking of the highest order and come Oscar season this will win all but a few of those statues."
7/10,Somewhat disappointing,08 2023,"Way too long. It could have lasted 1h less without a problem, cutting all the political part (remember the nice text at the end of a film that explains what happened next? Exactly what I was hoping for at a certain point). It is the first time EVER I looked at the watch continuously while at the cinema, hoping for an end. The acting was great but I did not like the plot AT ALL. I hated the imaginery ""Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Queen's Gambit"" scenes, I hated the flashbacks (some in B&W, while others not), I hated the fact Oppenheimer was so poorly depicted in his intimate personality and thoughts. Too much characters doing stuff alltogether, really I advise you to read a bit of history (like a who did what in real life) before watching the movie. At home, with lots of water and popcorn at your side."
5/10,Chris Nolan continues his war against cinemagoers buttocks,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Christopher Nolan made a masterpiece.,08 2023,"Is this the best movie Christopher Nolan ever made? I think so. This movie was a masterpiece. There wasn't a single scene I wanted to skip. I was too captivated by every part of this film. Cillian gives a performance that not only should bring him to his first Academy nomination but IMO should win him the whole thing. So did Downey. This was also the best performance by Emily Blunt I think ever. Matt Damon was fantastic, and Florence was too. Loved the small roles of 3 Academy Award winners with Affleck being terrifying with just a little screen time, Oldman being unrecognizable and Malek stealing the last 20 minutes of the film. Hoyte van Hoytema once again made fantastic cinematography one of his best and Ludwig Göransson ATE that score. I think it's one of the best scores in a film ever. Period! I have chills listening to those melodies even now. What a score."
10/10,Movie of the Year (?),07 2023,"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date."
8/10,"While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best works in history.",07 2023,"Christopher Nolan, whose previous works use time and space as his playground, did it once again with this based on a true story film, something that we didn't expect. His way of storytelling proves that he's the greatest directors to ever live on the planet, mastering in building up the story all the while keeping the audience engaged by elevating its suspense, scope, atmosphere and music tempos, creating a masterpiece ouevre."
7/10,Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.,07 2023,"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced."
10/10,The single greatest accomplishment of Hollywood in the last 5 years,07 2023,"It is fitting that a film about a person as consequential as Oppenheimer ended up being crafted by one of the most visionary directors of our time. Oppenheimer is a victory for filmmaking, a tour de force of incredible visuals, breathtaking cinematography and a sweeping scope that makes this narrative so illuminating. Every single aspect of this film blends into a seamless, awe inspiring experience where despite its gargantuan runtime, we are transfixed to a portrait of a man who's legend will forever be written in history. Brought alive by a phenomenon Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is the single greatest argument that movies and the theatrical experience still can mean something. If you watch this, definitely watch in 70mm IMAX - it's so worth it."
7/10,Not worth the extra money spent on IMAX,07 2023,"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means."
3/10,Three hours of not so much,07 2023,For me this movie doesn't do anything. The acting is good but that is the only thing that is likeable. There is simply nothing interesting (for me that is) about this movie.
10/10,"Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.",07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content."
10/10,It's clever but it also has a heart,07 2023,"Nolan strangely moves from petentious films, bad ones right away after you take the glitter away, to straight ahead masterworks of movie making. He seams to go 1 good 1 bad each time. Now it was time for a good one after the pretentious, sloppy Tenet. And boy did he deliver. This is a wonderful, challenging, unapologetic, very brave in some political way piece of movie making. Well acted all along, well written, large in scope but fully accomplishing. But it's what lies underneath what I love the most. I'm totally in love with the political subplots: younger generations need to be reminded not only about the dangers of the bomb, but for the equally killing Macarthysms. Call it how you want it, the blind, stupid far righters are a danger to the world."
10/10,"If this isn't a masterpiece, I don't know what else is.",08 2023,"Oppenheimer is a rare biopic which, in spite of being driven entirely by dialogue and character drama, never bored me at any point. I was so amazed by the film that even after many a times not understanding the scientific stuff and all, I was glued to the screen, understanding it through the characters and their actions alone. I loved every bit of it and was totally focused. Once it was over, I walked out with a sense of satisfaction."
10/10,Nolan did it again,08 2023,"This film is a damn masterpiece. There are not enough words to propperly describe it and, at the same time, few sentences can truly explain how good this film is. And i can't say its flawless, but its ""flaws"" are so escarce and so minimum that the don't really matter."
7/10,"Mixed bag, and yes, I was bored",07 2023,"Was looking forward to seeing this movie on the big screen. Big fan of Nolan's previous movies and I usually like political and historical drama. On one side giving this movie anything less than '7' is hard, due to spectacular technical creation and a wonderful story told, but also I would argue that this movie does not deliver enough for its 3 hours length, in terms of interest and emotional attachment for the audience."

10/10,Astounding - and not for any special effects,07 2023,"This is one of the most intriguing and astounding movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in my over 60 years of movie going. Yes, there are some impressive special effects, but they are truly the least impressive things here."
10/10,Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie,07 2023,"Rating: 9.6 Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future)."
9/10,Oscars all round,07 2023,"I don't believe any film can be a 10 no film is perfect but this film is very close. All the acting is amazing, Cillian Murphy tells a whole story with his eyes giving one of the best solo performances in cinema history , Robert Downey jr really amazed me, I was not expecting his performance to be as good as it was, an Oscar for both of them. Also, not talked enough about whenever this film is mentioned, is how good and believable Matt Damon is as Leslie groves. The cinematography is amazing - I really suggest watching it in imax to get the full experience. The use of music is brilliant. I was hooked from start to finish Nolan's best."
10/10,People who call it boring should have watched something else,07 2023,"What an amazing movie, the visuals, sound, music, acting, directing, everything was 10/10, dont watch the film without knowing some history, its very philosophical type of movie, it makes you question about your actions, reflect on life, consequences, every minute of 3hr was amazing there was no boring scene, very good pacing, I understand its not meant for all audiences, yeah some scenes maybe could have been avoided but regardless the purpose of the movie was executed, definitely the type of movie that will be remembered for a long time. We can already expect it to leas best picture, actor, supporting actor, actress, sound, score, director, adapted screenplay and many more,"
10/10,You've never seen a film like Oppenheimer,07 2023,"It's taken me a few days to be able to sit down and write down my thoughts about Christoper Nolan's newest big screen epic, the other part of the now infamous ""Barbenheimer"" double bill that has been re-writing record books over there launch weekends, having had this time to ponder and contemplate I am confident in saying that I've never seen a film quite like this biopic and while it's a film with flaws and components that don't stick their respective landings, Nolan's film is nevertheless a powerful, poignant and technically marvellous piece of original film-making that further establishes the esteemed director as a generational talent whose skill set is unrivalled."
6/10,Not really sure what to think.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
7/10,Not bad but not great either,07 2023,"For a three hour film, it still proved not enough time to cover any part of his life with enough time to explore. Music all the way through the film which at times made me struggle to hear what was being said. Also felt that some scenes would have played better without music. Due to what felt like a rush to complete so many strands of his life, I never felt connected or to understand the man. A great cast but a film I would not watch again. I was never bored but it just did not have any emotional impact which surprised me. I am not a fan of nolan's previous film Tenet either. Three hours felt more like a rush job and was, in my opinion, average."
5/10,Confusing!,08 2023,"Yeah, I got lost a few times in this movie by the continual switching time periods. And had a difficult time understanding some of the dialogue because of the loud soundtrack. I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on. But this movie I won't do that."
9/10,it's the world in which we now live,07 2023,"Obviously a lot of the talk about Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" has involved its release the same day as Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Now that I've seen the former, all that I can say is that you must immediately drop everything and go see this movie, for it reminds you of the world in which we now live."
10/10,Masterpiece,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction and Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer bring history to life with an intense and emotionally charged performance. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, seamlessly transporting the audience to the World War II era. The intricate storytelling delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life, showcasing his brilliance as a scientist and the moral dilemmas he faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. Thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating, Oppenheimer challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of scientific discoveries. The supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding depth and nuance to this profound narrative. In all aspects, Oppenheimer is a triumph that leaves a lasting impact, reminding us of the power of cinema to enlighten and inspire."
10/10,Story and the artist is so perfect,07 2023,"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film."
10/10,The best film of 2023!,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 10 out of 10 for me. Also I would rank it as one of Nolan's best films ever!"
6/10,I had low expectations going in..,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Nolan's best film to date.,07 2023,"Like Martin Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock before him Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. A film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. But what will his followers think of ""Oppenheimer""? Will today's movie-going generation even know who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening I attended I saw two people leave), and can Nolan do justice to his subject?"
6/10,Excellent acting ruined by excessive pace,08 2023,"Christopher Nolan movies have always been fairly demanding of the viewer, but I think Oppenheimer finally takes it a step too far. The acting is superb and the subject interesting, but the pacing of the movie demands that the viewer is either 100 years old and has a clear recollection of the time, or has been researching the topic for the past several years in order to fully understand what is happening. The movie feels like a 3 hour long trailer, a speeding train that never slows down to allow the audience to catch their breath. There was a lot of great dialogue delivered by fantastic actors, but it is so mired in jump cuts and overly loud continuous music that it feels like a massive missed opportunity. The best way I can describe it is someone trying to perform a poetry reading in the middle of a techno concert. The movie certainly peaked my interest in Oppenheimer, and I will probably research this time in history more, but I am glad the movie is over."

9/10,BRILLANTTIO.. EXCEPIONAL// WATCH,09 2023,"Exceptional Film In a time of madness for Nolan to have brought this to us now, we can be so thankful. Aimed squarely at our military industrial complex.

10/10,Masterful IMAX experience!,07 2023,"Even with 3 hours sleep and a stomach ache for most of the day I didn't yawn once I was absolutely captivated/enthralled more than I thought I would be. This better be up for at least 10 nominations! It's very impressive how Christopher Nolan wrote and directed such an in depth crafty art political brilliance filled ironic to my sleep amount of this long winded extravaganza that is well acted throughout. I have autism I crave quantum mechanics, I even understood the numerous studies science related. One of the best Christoper Nolan films of his career, my last name is Nolan too I wish I was related to him! The sound design throughout is exceptional I'm sure that'll even win an award. I'm glad despite feeling rough today I got to see Oppenheimer with my mom and sister Emily."

6/10,Confusionheimer,08 2023,"I don't know man, was this really necessary? Three different time stages for just a biopic? Sure, it's Nolan and there is no way Nolan would tell a straight story, but overall the movie did not work for me. I mean, come on, just tell the story, spit it out man. From A (development of da bomb) to B (Military exploits it) to C (remorse and political aftermath). Is it necessary to mix this all up?"
5/10,Self-conflicting and futile,09 2023,"The biopic of Oppenheimer, the inventor of atomic bomb, is depicted in a weird fashion. The movie starts from his early career days at university and follows his transfer to the Manhattan Project. The movie is too long and made bitty with a non-linear narrative which I found completely unnecessary. The viewer is usually distracted with scenes from the future showing his trial against some people. Those distractions are too long and very annoying. There are too many characters and they are all underdeveloped. I didn't understand what the point is in deliberately confusing the viewer."
8/10,A Celebration of Intellectual Movies,08 2023,"Comic books, Marvel, Remakes, Franchises, and garbage is the norm."
10/10,'Classic Nolan Art',07 2023,"Nolan yet again proved that why he's one of the finest directors till date with 0 disappointing movies.. Oppenheimer is exceptional..! Brilliant at performance level..terrifying and horrifying tense music..highly convincing screenplay..terrific and beautiful visuals..dark and complex nature (not comparable toll to other Nolan classics)... Literally Nolan itself - school of masterpiece arts .. Oppenheimer is very great epic and non linear..It will sure shot very horrific movie not for every audience! If you are dying to watch pure drama portion oriented cinema, If you want to see some terrifying psychological brilliance and If you're fan of anyone who are involved in this film - Go For It!! Oppenheimer should remain forever until the drama school and making exist."
10/10,Christopher Nolan is the only filmmaker who can craft an entire series within a three-hour movie!,07 2023,"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere."
10/10,Pretty much perfect,07 2023,"This isn't my type of film, I normally get bored or find the slow pace just loses my interest, my dad wanted to see this so I thought I'd go and give it a chance."
9/10,Just got amazed,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is not solely based on the Trinity. It's entirely political drama. Just a reminder to the audience of how obsessed humans are with power and fame. Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless."
6/10,The soundtrack needs to really quiet down sometimes,07 2023,Oppenheimer (2023):
7/10,Politics Of The Bomb,07 2023,"Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for. There is surprisingly little of the Nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". This was easier to follow and harder to watch than TENET."
4/10,"Below expectation, except Robert Downey Jr.'s characterization",09 2023,"I don't think this movie hits my expectation. The emotional aspects and drama overshadows the intricate details of physics and chemistry that should have been more prominent and masterfully depicted. Watch this movie thoroughly and you'll notice that Mr. Oppenheimer is not contributing much to the bomb creation, not even showing much of a leadership quality during adversities. He's depicted as a creature of emotions. The fact that he's womanising is not clearly depicted. The only character that I am thoroughly impressed with and the only character that have driven this lose movie is Robert Downey Jr.'s character. He's the reason you found ""something"" within this movie. And what special effects are they talking about? There ain't one! I am getting little weary of Nolan's reputation overshadowing his recent works!"
10/10,"Christopher Nolan gives us a brilliant drama with Cillian Murphy giving us his best performance yet, one of the best films of the decade - My Ultimate Review",07 2023,"My expectations are always high for a film made by Christopher Nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. What we get is a three hour biopic of Oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. My girlfriend thought it was too long though so I think it's a preference. You could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. Stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like Strauss makes us see how others see Robert Oppenheimer and it only helps the story Christopher Nolan is telling. Any fan of Christopher Nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and It's done perfectly. Alternating between Oppenheimer's story from Cambridge to Los Alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and Strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959."
10/10,The tik tok era is very apparent,07 2023,"This movie is easily one of the best films this century yet despite that it gets called ""boring"" because it doesn't have action sequences in the film. It seems like most people seen this because of the whole barbenheimer trend and not for the story about Robert J Oppenheimer. Calling this the most boring movie ever is crazy. And calling it confusing is understandable but if you paid attention to what they were saying you would understand the timelines. It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry."
10/10,BEST MOVIE OF 2023,07 2023,"Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless."
10/10,Or: Lewis Strauss Meets the Theoretical Physical Godzilla,07 2023,"A full throated, adult - I mean to say perfectly serious - epic story about American exceptionalism and how that is more likely than not a total crock; what the film is truly about, at least in my immediate estimation before I sleep on it, is how easily it is to make many, many enemies in a country that is at SuperPower status in a world where Nazism can fold and then Communism (or just you know anyone the Government disagrees with) can be next. It's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the Atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it."
8/10,Powerful docudrama,08 2023,"A dramatization of the life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bomb, thus helping end World War 2. We see his life from university days all the way to post-WW2, where his fame saw him embroiled in political machinations."
7/10,"Amazing movie technically, but too long and a bit meh on the story",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Cinema,07 2023,Christopher Nolan is a savant of filmmaking. Cillian Murphy SHINES in this movie. They are one absolutely amazing duo. Not to mention a strong supporting cast around them and.
7/10,Sound editing is the real hero of this film,07 2023,A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.
3/10,As a Nolan fan this was boring,07 2023,"Boring movie, which is mostly political court room scenes."
10/10,Another masterpiece by Christopher nolan,07 2023,For me this movies is the best movie in this decade and one of the best nolan movie ever seen and one of the best movies of the all time actually this movis is top 5 movie I ever seen cillian is the best and deserve oscar and oppenhimer deserve oscar for best picture and cinematography and music and more
8/10,"Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds",07 2023,"This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like C. Nolan. I also really liked this movie. The movie is told from Oppenheimer's point of view. I think it was fine. Some scientific topics were very difficult to understand for me. I think the bomb scene was good. I think the acting was very good. Cillian Murphy played the static, cold character very well. Robert Downey Jr. Played great too. I think tacting was generally so good. I think there were some boring scenes in the movie. There were scenes in the cinema where I started to sleep out of boredom. But overall, I think it deserves an ""8"" point. This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like it. I also watched the other movie (pink movie) first. It was so good after that movie."
10/10,Wow! What a powerful and engagaing movie!,07 2023,"Wow! This movie just knocked me out! So many parts of the movie were just excellent. I think I need a little time to fully process everything.. but I left the theater just in awe of the movie. Acting, script, cinematography, directing, score, sound, and visuals... were all just amazing."
10/10,Despite all the hype it was THAT incredible,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Great Biopic About a Man Who Changed Everything,08 2023,This was a movie that I was intrigued when I heard it was coming out. I do enjoy Christopher Nolan's films. I'm a bigger fan of Cillian Murphy though. I knew that this was a speculate so I was trying to see how I could fit this into my schedule. The three-hour runtime was daunting as well. The Gateway Film Center has been showing this on 70mm so I wanted to see it that way. The stars aligned on a Sunday for me to catch this.
7/10,"Some great parts, well made. Too long, kind of dull. Didn't care for any of the characters.",08 2023,"TL:DR. - Too long, kind of dull. Didn't care for any of the characters."
10/10,Cillian should at least get nominated,07 2023,I can't express enough how absolutely phenomenal this movie is. It will stand the test of time and will possibly go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.
6/10,Good...but should have been great.,08 2023,"A muddled first 45 mins which provides a feeling that in the hands of another director, this could have been an all-time classic. Several years were covered but the viewer had no idea how many years and which year was which."
5/10,late 1 hour for cinema screening? You won't miss anything,07 2023,"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again."
10/10,Brilliant filmmaking,08 2023,"A totally mesmerizing film that has stayed with me long after I saw it. To begin, the performances down the line are superb. Murphy and Downey, Jr. Should be Oscar winners if there is any justice. But there's not a false note in the ensemble. Robert Oppenheimer is fascinating character. Hero or villain? The film gives us both perspectives and lets us decide for ourselves. The non linear storytelling works brilliantly because what could have seemed like two films works seamlessly as one. Three hours flies by. While I am not a Christopher Nolan fanatic, after seeing this, I have to admit the man is a genius. Cannot wait to see it again."
10/10,Excellence surpassed,08 2023,"10 stars are not enough. This film is written stupendously well, the script is so intricate and complex it befits the mind of an uber genius like Oppenheimer explored by the genius of Nolan."
10/10,Nolan's best so far,07 2023,"As a devoted fan of historical dramas, I can confidently say that ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece! Christopher Nolan has once again delivered an awe-inspiring cinematic experience that leaves the audience spellbound from start to finish."
6/10,"Too much of telling, less on showing",07 2023,"Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets."
6/10,Overrated,09 2023,"The film failed to deliver on the hype. It is certainly Oscar-material, well produced and with great actors, but that doesn' t mean it was entertaining. The three hours were a bit too long, and, by the way,, what's so wrong with the traditional 2h-format, not many films deserve longer than that, and Oppenheimer is not one of them.. In my opinion too much footage was wasted on the congressional hearing and on the 'trial', which may be intresting for an American audience, but not so much for international viewers. The ethical dilemnas on building the bomb were justed hinted at, and that would have a more universal appeal."
3/10,"Pretentious, Portentous, and exceedingly Tedious",09 2023,"Christopher Nolan appears to be like Marmite. You either love or loathe. Those who adore all he touches, will needless to say tell you that this is the Greatest Movie of All Time, Oscar Certainty, etc. Etc."
9/10,Best Actor Goes To Cillian Murphy,07 2023,"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life."
9/10,Christopher Nolan strikes again,07 2023,"This movie was an amazing treat. As with all Christopher Nolan movies, the filmography was excellent, audio shook you and really brought up emotions of despair and beauty in certain scenes. I watched this in an IMAX theater so all the sensory effects with amplified. The actors were amazing too."
8/10,Time Jumbly (7.8),08 2023,Interestingly enough i didn't mind the length. I do enjoy sitting in a dark room staring at a massive imax screen for 3 hours more then i thought i would. Mostly because this movie is really quite beautiful.
10/10,All round excellent biography,07 2023,The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer.
6/10,Nothing special,07 2023,"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon."
6/10,disappointing,09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
5/10,Too many long stretches with no stakes,08 2023,"The reason this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece is because 3-hour biopics are rarely successful at the box office - after years of superhero dominance, critics understandably want to promote something different."
10/10,Boom.,07 2023,"My goodness, what a disturbing film. I found the first hour to be very slow and a bit hard to follow. I definitely want to give it a second look so I can obtain a clearer understanding of all the different characters and moving parts. But once the intensity begins, it does not let up and it builds and builds and builds until the breathtaking conclusion."
9/10,"""Can you hear the music?""",07 2023,"Synopsis: Oppenheimer handles a huge project of the creation of the atomic bomb that leads to all kinds of consequences on his personal life and many others surrounding him. This leads him to be the father of the atomic bomb and ""the destroyer of worlds"" as he becomes one of the most important figures in history."
10/10,More than amazing,07 2023,"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie."
10/10,I believe we did it..,07 2023,"Oppenheimer, a truly masterpiece movie made just for the big screen. Best movie of the year and one of the greatest movie of our generation. This movie is not for casual movie watchers (wasn't that obvious?) But fir those who know how to appreciate real cinema. This movie needs to be understood in a way u never did. You want horror and science in a three hours long movie? This is it. Can't explain the feeling it set off inside us. I had been waiting for this movie since it's announcement and I am not disappointed, the movie feels like its slow but once it's over it feels like nothing. It leaves a deep impact on you."
6/10,Unlikeable womanizer builds a bomb,07 2023,"Acting was great, considering the plot is a boring documentary buried underneath a pretencious confusing cerebral adventure through multiple timelines. This movie was seemingly written by somebody who is old and confused, unable to piece the story together in a coherent way but able to remember it in extreme detail. A collection of trailer-like cuts almost built for a generation of people with a shorter attention span, making me feel like i was being explained the story instead of watching it."
10/10,Phenomenal,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
7/10,Long Winded,07 2023,"This in the minds of most critics is cinematic gold. The casting, score, set pieces, and direction is some of the finest in the business. The cinematography is out've this world. A beautifully shot film from start to finish."
5/10,Less would have been more,07 2023,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped."
10/10,The one and only masterpiece,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):"
9/10,Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,2023's Most Devastating Movie!,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Not Nolan's best but still worth a watch!!,07 2023,Oppenheimer review :
9/10,"Brilliant Performances, Brilliant Direction, but multiple viewings required",07 2023,"The much awaited historical entry from one of my favourite directors, Christopher Nolan, is finally out. It's being well received from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I can say it more or less deserves that reception."
7/10,Oppenheimer honest review,08 2023,"Oppenheimer is a overall mediocre film. It depends too much on sound effects, and loud, sudden flashes as seen in the beginning, the only thing that makes the film engaging to the audience. There is a lot of unnecessary content, and is hard to understand even for Christopher Nolan standards. The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie. It would've been better for the film if the bombs were shown dropped in the beginning and have the story told in a reversed manner."
8/10,"A challenging viewing experience, but powered by the performances.",07 2023,"One of the most anticipated films of this year and who better to deliver the film none other than Christopher Nolan. Nolan makes the audience think, and I think for me at least it will click better with a second viewing much like DUNKIRK or TENENT. Nevertheless the shoulders of this film is carried by Cillian Murphy who finally gets to showcase his talents as a lead. He's always been a treat to watch on screen and I'm very happy for him. He deserves all the praise."
9/10,A Visually Stunning and Emotionally Captivating Journey into History,08 2023,"In his latest masterpiece, Christopher Nolan brings the life of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen with exceptional performances from an ensemble cast. Through astounding visual effects and practical in-camera techniques, Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that immerses viewers into Oppenheimer's world. While requiring multiple viewings to grasp its nuances, Oppenheimer remains a must-watch for cinephiles who appreciate the artistry behind filmmaking. With a perfect balance between hero and villain, the characterization of Oppenheimer tugs at the audience's emotions, leaving them invested throughout the three-hour journey. Despite minor sound mix issues, Nolan's exploration of history and science makes Oppenheimer a thought-provoking and visually spectacular cinematic delight. 🎬"
10/10,Calmly astounding,07 2023,"In recent years, usually when a film has such a packed cast it often never met expectations so I didn't have many for this, I was confident it was gonna be good but refrained from gauging how good it could actually be. Quoting Greek mythology really set the tone for the rest of the movie. Christopher Nolan is known for blending some sci-fi to his more renowned movies; this is a history biopic but has a lot of elements resembling sci-fi. Building something that at the time period, could only be a pigment of one's imagination. The movie blends together mythology, physics, betrayal, history, philosophy, politics and moral conundrums... maybe this is recency bias but I think this is one of Christopher Nolan's best work."
10/10,It's da bomb,07 2023,"I struggled a little bit - I mean it is the obvious pun (that as always is not intended - never ever, yes?), so should I take the easy one? Well as you can see: I did. There were a few others I considered yesterday ... but none that really would have ... the impact of this one (yes I can't stop - like Oppenheimer himself maybe?) ... one if you are really that curious involved Asteroid City - not just because they came out this year - you also had many talented actors in it and a setting in the desert. Although it was mainly desert for AC and only partly for Oppenheimer of course."
10/10,Wow! Magnificent! My new favourite film.,07 2023,"That you Mr Christopher Nolan for your effort with this fantastic film. You exceeded my already very high expectations - I've been anticipating this film for over six months. Thank you for choosing a fantastic cast to present such a masterpiece. The visual and auditory experience is something I want to experience again, particularly when it's still available in the premium cinemas."
6/10,"Cool concept, interesting, seems historically accurate.",09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,"Intense, another Nolan classic but very different",07 2023,"I don't know where to begin. This movie was just so intense. Like every Nolan movie, it has completely enveloped my mind. I'm obsessed with it. It's haunting me."
8/10,"Intelligent dialogue, intricate flashes forward/back. Downside: overlong on explosions and imagined atom interaction",07 2023,"Director Christopher Nolan has to be praised for coming up with another very good film, after THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, TENET and others. He connects technology with the human mind more successfully than any other director I can think of these days."
10/10,Just watched Oppenheimer,08 2023,"I watched this movie in IMAX 70mm and what an experience it was! What Christopher Nolan was able to create here was something truly special. The performances from the whole cast is outstanding every actor and actress deserves an Oscar. Especially Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer, he is so and committed to the role. Another stand out performance is Robert Downey Junior, it shows that he's not just iron man. The dialogue is so gripping and you feel so invested in the story that is being told. The scene when they actually detonate the bomb was spectacular. The way the film ends leaves you walking out scared of the world we live in."
10/10,A Landmark Movie,07 2023,"To make a movie of this standard on a 100 million dollar budget is a significant achievement by a modern filmmaker. For 180 minutes, Oppenheimer narrates a single story and opens up multiple themes like a flower blooming. It is vivid but not obvious, there lies the success of the movie."

5/10,"Nolan's ""Kitchen Sink"" Approach Makes This Long-Winded Biopic Hard to Follow",09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,A Fantastic Film,07 2023,"It wasn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping for, but Oppenheimer is still a really fantastic movie."
9/10,Destroyer of Worlds,07 2023,"Here is what you need to know. Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the decade. This is a film you must see, regardless of whether or not you watch a lot of movies. See it on the biggest IMAX screen you can. It is as much an engrossing document of vital history as it is an unparalleled sensory experience. This film is of course about the invention of nuclear weaponry, and of course, you'll get up close and personal to a real detonation. But that's nowhere near the thrill behind Oppenheimer. In fact, there isn't supposed to be one. Oppenheimer is a blistering indictment of the bomb's creation and a passionate anti-war plea. What's more, is that this is a masterful character study about the man behind the bomb, and the agonizing regret he felt about creating it in the first place."
9/10,A great film,09 2023,"I had originally thought this was a flawless film but upon reflection, I changed my mind. It is a magnificient film, with a splendid cast. It makes the science interesting and understandable (which could not have been easy) and it doesn't avoid the provocative politics of the situation. My complaint is that the audience does not necessarily understand why Oppenheimer is so arrogant and so celebrated. The film opens by showing how insecure and troubled he was, and then jumps ahead to the Manhattan Project without showing how he came to be so admired and so impressed with himself. It also shows many contenious relationships he had, leaving one to wonder why the Project scientists supported him decades later despite their dismay over the use of the bombs. I would have liked just a bit more showing his intellectual growth in his earlier years as well as his management of the Project. (I supposed I should read the book.)"
10/10,Beyond expectations,07 2023,The movie delivers more than i even expected.
10/10,Oppenheimer is a uniquely intriguing and infinitely compelling Cinematic Experience.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
6/10,Nolan should just stay away from historical productions.,08 2023,"This is the second film of Nolan's I have watched that features historical events and characters. For such a monumental slice of human history, this movie fails to emphasize the most important bits. It most certainly did not scratch the itch that I had developed when I found out it existed!"
10/10,This could have been a movie about a HAM SANDWICH and...,09 2023,"I'm convinced that this could have been about a ham sandwich, slowly rotting in a poorly lit corner, and I'd be totally engrossed. Subject matter aside, this is a brilliantly crafted film. For 3 hours, it holds you tight and teases to drop you, only to bring you even higher."
7/10,Good film - Maybe someday I'll regain my hearing,07 2023,"Well, Oppy is quite an experience. In many ways it's an amazing film, BUT... it's stubbornly nonlinear, as if someone shuffled the storyboards. And somewhat impressionistic. I think Nolan was trying to capture in visuals both the psychological noise of that super-secret project and the zeitgeist of that pressure-packed era - without abandoning the narrative. At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs. It really helps if you know the arc of Oppenheimer's story, or at least the moral ambiguity that tempered the scientific deadline to develop a device that ""could"" end life on earth."
9/10,A Bombastic Experience,07 2023,Oppenheimer is absolutely a testament as to how outstanding Christopher Nolan is in his art of filmmaking.
10/10,"Oppenheimer is an absolutely thought provoking, cinematic masterpiece.",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,"Death, Destroyer of Worlds",07 2023,"Oppenheimer is something else entirely and what makes it so fascinating is that it's so hard to distinguish what it really is. Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig Göransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty."
10/10,An Epic Cinematic Experience,07 2023,"This week has seen one of the craziest times for cinema with the release of both Barbie and this film Oppenheimer. Hopefully, this gives cinema the shot in the arm that it needs and truly provides some great cinema. I have seen Oppenheimer and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film examines the life of Robert Oppenheimer, the man who was behind the development of the atomic bomb."
10/10,I'm speechless with reflective despair,07 2023,"The pit in your stomach deepens as every layer of this 3-hour experience unravels, revealing what could possibly be the most thought provoking film up to date. There's a level of excellence that is broken down to various elements that complement one another in ways that I could never predetermine. From a shuddering score by Ludwig Göransson, to the distinctively believable cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the rattling sound design, the massive and completely grounded cast, and most importantly a story that speaks for itself with the emotions that overwhelm you as you leave the theater. Christopher Nolan never underestimates the intelligence and grasp that humans have while watching his films and he follows that same pattern in his 12th installment by introducing details that seem ambiguous at a first glance until they slowly formulate the defining moments to conclude this film. Cillian Murphy is disciplined in every mannerism that he physically expresses along with every bit of anxiety that he attempts to keep in. Another chapter to mark a defining moment in Nolan's career and hopefully one that will receive its worthy credit."
10/10,Exceeded Expectations,07 2023,"Best movie in my lifetime. All aspects were exemplary: the acting, the writing, the cinematography, ... I've never paid much attention to which director is doing what, but Christopher Nolan is one to watch for. Brilliant."
6/10,Is Christopher Nolan become a prankster?,07 2023,"Everything Nolan said about this movie almost does not match its truth, talking about IMAX technology, and the scene of the explosion that the audience will shudder at as if it were real, and about the scenes included in the trailer, all of which gives a very different impression of the movie ..! The huge publicity of the film made the audience (including myself) raise their expectations, and even get ready to watch a movie different from the one they saw in the movie theatre .. Yes, the movie is good, the performance of all the actors is excellent, Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy did amazing performance .. But this is not what they sold us in the trailer and the advertisements of the movie that almost tell about another movie completely .."
9/10,Just like all other Nolan movies its the best IMAX experience,07 2023,"Give it up to Christopher Nolan he knows how to make an Imax picture and he's dictated to this format like no other. Other filmmakers who say they make movies in IMAX are cheating you just a little. Like the last good IMAX movie, Mission: Impossible Dark Reckoning. Christopher McQuarrie knows all the good action scenes to put into IMAX to cheat you out of the entire flick being IMAX but Nolan is not about that and that makes for a beautiful motion picture."

9/10,Cillian Murphy Finally An A Lister,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,My mind exploding.,07 2023,"As Cillian Murphy said, this movie will grab you in the neck and make you fully invest in the whole movie. And that's what it did to me. Oppenheimer is a different level of horrifying movie that will stick with you the next, next, day (or your whole life) and just fully ""explode"" your mind. Just be prepared to be on the edge of your seat as this gripping movie takes you on an exhilarating rollercoaster of emotions and suspense."
10/10,Oppenheimer Is The Movie We Expected From Christopher Nolan,07 2023,"When I was leaving the car, heading to the theatre, my expectations were really low. Then, when I bought the ticket, the trailer was playing on a TV, and I thought I was being stupid by thinking a Christopher Nolan movie would be boring and would suck."
9/10,The Father Of The Atomic Bomb,07 2023,"Plays like a chain reaction, bouncing between past and present, actions and consequences. This is a blistering piece of filmmaking that's only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambition"

10/10,Unforgettable. A work of genius.,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is by no small margin the most profound movie I've ever seen. It is no exaggeration to say that this film is a work of genius. Not just on part of the directing and screenplay, but interestingly enough, the editing. In a 3-hour movie, there wasn't a single wasted frame. The editing and sound design played such pivotal roles in the film in adding layers of depth beyond even the script and dialogue. I never thought I'd see a movie that has quite literally no action whatsoever but never-the-less never a dull moment. Every scene is pertinent, every line explosive and powerful. Featuring one of the most star-studded casts I've ever seen (I recognized every actor in the movie) giving the performances of their lifetimes, I strongly suspect everyone from the director, editor, writer, composer to the majority of the cast will receive tons of well-deserved accolades for this feature. I went in expecting it to be very good and very powerful. I came out experiencing a masterpiece of cinema, one I'm likely never to forget."
6/10,A historical drama without any accurate history!,08 2023,Nolan's movies are about science and explanations and art. This was a bad biographic movie about a controversial person.
10/10,A masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. This film will be remembered forever..,07 2023,"I was very excited to watch Oppenheimer for a long time and it didn't disappoint. It's very interesting and overwhelming film from the start to the end I enjoyed every single second of it and all the details, and I really liked the acting of the characters like Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. And it is in my top 10 or actually my top five favorite movies of all time the storyline was amazing and everything connected very well. It seems like a story, and I know it's based on a true story. It was very, very good. I thetic of the film was very old money, and I didn't know how to explain it, but it was very luxury in a way that I like it, and the science was like another story like it was very interesting, and the quantum physics and theories was very interesting, and how Oppenheimer was feeling guilty about his own doing, and everything makes sense and they just got the feeling that they got in interstellar that's all top five favorite movies of all time."
6/10,Barbenheimer: Barbie and Ken diffuse the A-bomb.,08 2023,"Greta Gerwig managed to make a plastic doll feel human, but Nolan managed to make the father of the atomic bomb feel plastic. This three hour long convoluted, bloated and overblown story was very slow and disjointed, and felt poorly edited with random physics imagery thrown in between scene changes."
2/10,Pretentious; Tries Too Hard; All Technique; No Drama,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" 2023. Biopic of ""Father of the atomic bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Cillian Murphy and an all-star cast and multiple cameo appearances: Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and her girls, Robert Downey Jr, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Josh Harnett, Tom Conti, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Matthew Modine, Benny Safdie, and Rin Tin Tin."

10/10,A MATURE EPIC DESERVING ALL ITS PRAISE.,07 2023,"It's nearly impossible to put into words any kind of worthy analysis of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. This is the most mature story Nolan has ever taken on, which without a doubt will alienate some of the auteur's lesser educated fan base and leave them scratching their heads. I know that statement may come off as pompous, but it's true. This film will not impress EVERYBODY. However, for an intellectual, it is beautiful unbiased storytelling at its finest. In my personal opinion it's Christopher Nolan's best film to date."
10/10,Cillian Murphy Steals The Show,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan can be immensely proud of the overall performances of all of his cast in 'Oppenheimer', however a certain Mr Murphy, stands out."
10/10,Makes up for that mess of a movie called Tenet,07 2023,"Wow! The hype clip from earlier this year did this film no justice. Scene by scene, line by line you feel Oppenheimer's struggle and his shift in morality. This movie will be mentioned as an all time classic. A masterclass of film making as well as acting. Murphy, Blunt, Downey, & Damon all deserve merit, credit, and all the accolades for top their notch performances. Paced extremely well (a three hour experience) does not feel like three hours. Excellent audio and visuals throughout. There is nothing I can complain or criticize about this film. It's the perfect film. The Godfather level perfection. This should be a fixture at every IMAX theater in perpetuity. Go see it. If you have already seen it once, see it again."
6/10,A Dud,07 2023,"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection."
10/10,Movie of the year,07 2023,This movie was a pure display of art. Every scene was extremely impactful and suspenseful. It was a long movie but you were intensely driven in the whole time. Cillian Murphy truly captured the character and showing the human side/ moral dilemmas of a man that believe that he gave the world the power to destroy itself was amazing. It showed showed a very real and what felt like very true side to a life alter event that happened in your history and you could feel every bit of that impact in the audience as these decisions were being made. The acting was great for all characters and the ability to give what felt like back stage passes to one of the biggest events in the past century was amazing. It puts very recent events and current events in perspective and gives the audience a lot to talk about and discuss. Well done.
6/10,Great performances in an underwhelming courtroom drama,07 2023,"I feel a bit disappointed with this movie. It was underwhelming for me. I know it's a biopic, but when the maker says you should watch it on a big screen, I expect it to contain a bit more science, something worthy of a big screen. But what we get is a biopic with a lot of politics and courtroom drama. I guess walking into a Nolan movie always expecting a spectacle like Inception or Interstellar can be disappointing."
10/10,A Great Biopic and Essay Film About the Contradiction of a Man Torn by Nuclear Dillemmas,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a smarter, more skilled and more serious film than any previous film by the talented Nolan could have led us to expect. It is at once an almost unrivaled biopic, a revealing historical document and a wake up call of gravest importance. As biopic it evokes the vividness of scene and ambiguity of protagonist portrait of the ultimately fictional ""Citizen Kane,"" and even some of that film's wit. As historical document it has the factual specificity of ""All the President's Men."" As historical document it packs the essay-like messaging and dramatic tension of ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" with comparable virtuosity and stronger final emotional and intellectual impacts."
8/10,IMAX is unnecessary,08 2023,I enjoyed this film very much. The actors were very well chosen. The three hours passed quite quickly which is a sign to me that a movie is successfully engaging.
10/10,Go watch this now!!!,07 2023,"This is the first ever IMDB review that I write because I need to give this movie my stars. The camera work is amazing. The cast is amazing and the story is even better. The only downside was the fast pacing wich you may see as a positive thing and the use op a lot of different names for characters. The use of those names was somethimes a little confusing but it does not really affect the story as it is always clear after some thime who they are referring to. Me and my friend just sat there in the cinema after the movie was done. Both baffeled by what happend and the ending. I got goosebumps 3 times from some moments in the movie, never had that before in my life. I have read some negative reviews wich say it was boring.... The only thing they think is not boring is dangeling from a thin wire above a 30meter drop or something but this movie was not even close to boring."

9/10,Nolan's Historical Epic,09 2023,"A brilliant historical biopic detailing the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, his role in the development of the atomic bomb and subsequent relationship with the US government."
7/10,"Great acting, boring lengthy story.............",08 2023,"Let's be clear about this, the film is NOT about the story of the race to build the first nuke. There is NOTHING here about the Axis effort to build the bomb. This film is just about Oppenheimer, and it's not even a biopic in the true sense, it's just the story of HIS effort to build the bomb, with the assistance of a group of mostly Jewish scientists. Murphy is completely superb in the role, he IS Oppenheimer! This is one of the best acting performances I've ever seen and if Murphy doesn't pick up an Oscar then this world is mad. The storyline itself gets wrapped up in Oppenheimer's personal life and his later struggles to avoid being labelled as a communist and a security risk. There is little about Oppenheimer's early life and his family background; you are often made to feel that he was some kind of heroic figure when in truth he was a very flawed human being. There is even a scene when Oppenheimer's wife worries about him losing his job and their nice home - total BS because Oppenheimer was a rich man independently of his job. He inherited the equivalent of $4M in today's money when his father died early on in Oppenheimer's life and certainly would not have worried about losing his job. His job was a hobby, an obsessive hobby that he was brilliant at , but a hobby all the same - he did not need it to survive. The investigation story later on in the film was boring and lengthy, stretching out the film at least half an hour more than needed. It's necessary to call out Robert Downey Jr as Oppenheimer's FBI nemesis, Lewis Strauss, for a brilliant acting performance, and credit also needs to go to Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, both of whom were excellent. The bit parts played by Branagh, Conti and Oldman were, predictably, executed superbly by these masterful actors. The female cast was a disappointment, but then they didn't have much material to get their teeth into, so hardly surprising. Overall I give this film 7 out of 10 for the great acting, but the storyline was poorly handled by Nolan, not one of my favourite directors. Lastly, the very loud sounds and music (if you call it that) during the film ruined much of the enjoyment."
4/10,why these top rating?,08 2023,"SO classic, as soon as there's a movie with a somewhat 'deeper' meaning, people would praise it beyond.measure and even talk about oscars...even though there are SO many other movies that are way..WAY better than this one. But i guess it's all about the genre that counts, not the actual movie. If it's a horror or comedy flick, it can't be good right? Well...it's not an entirely 'bad' movie but literally nothing's happening for 3 hrs straight. The whole movie is just one long dialogue...for 3 hrs."

10/10,Better Than Typical Nolan Fare!,07 2023,Not your typical Nolan pic but that's a good thing.
10/10,What audiovisual art can do for us if we dare let it,08 2023,"In the months leading up to Oppenheimer, two things were made clear from the buzz surrounding it: Christopher Nolan doesn't eff around with digital effects, and its sequence of the Trinity test -- where J. Robert Oppenheimer is indeed ""become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" as the Sanskrit quotation goes -- was said to be the most powerful and devastating thing you'll ever experience in a theater, IMAX or otherwise. Conclusion: It seemed likely that this will be the first film to kill its viewers with either fire or radiation poisoning. Tread carefully."
10/10,"There are good films, great films and there's masterpieces. This is the latter.",07 2023,"Christopher Nolan has created something truly unique. A biopic that is deep, intense, emotional, complex, makes you think, and actually hits you physically through sound... At least in Imax..."
10/10,Brilliant Film,07 2023,"If this film don't win Nolan an Oscar, I'm not sure what will!"
10/10,Greatest Cinematic Event of My Life,07 2023,"The movie was amazing, but aren't all of Nolan's films? That's not what I'm hear to talk about though. As an avid movie goer I cannot emphasize how important it is to experience this film in IMAX. I have watched 100's of movies in IMAX and this is hands down the greatest one of all time. I could feel sound and pressure in my chest throughout the film. I was paralyzed in my seat until the final hour of the film."
7/10,2h could have done it,08 2023,"Oppenheimer is composed of 95% dialogue, all of it well written by the way, and for 2h it becomes a little overwhelming. We get no chance to breathe and appreciate or take in what's just been said. Which is something I've felt throughout the movie, it's just more dialogue and more information fed to you one after the other."
6/10,"Over Hyped, under delivered",07 2023,The casting is phenomenal. A lot of people will go just on that basis. Sadly that's the only phenomenal element to the movie. The movie jumps around oddly without creating satisfying tales. There are missed opportunities to create and impact the real scale of the subject matter. This was a pivotal moment in human history but feels almost unremarkable because of how it was told here.
3/10,Consider yourself warned,08 2023,Consider yourself warned Very boring and waaaay too long. I didn't care about any of the characters or the petty hostilities between them.
10/10,"Biopic, history lesson and morality tale all in one, made by a megaton of talent",07 2023,"Christopher Nolan's movies are among the best ever made, be it his Dark Knight Trilogy, gritty and trope-challenging crime operas that happen to have superheroes in them, or his science-fiction movies like Inception and Interstellar, which are though-provoking, yet still with the required amusement factor for the blockbuster audience. His last sci-fi movie, Tenet, was as high concept as ever, but also complex to a fault, and somewhat lacking a heart to win over the big crowds. But even though every movie that Nolan makes is big, he tends to alternate between something more mainstream (for lack of a better term) and something that feels a bit smaller and more personal. And though it tackles big themes, few of his movies feel so personal as Oppenheimer."
10/10,"Deserves all the hype and all the accolades in the future! Oscars, here we come!",07 2023,"A cinematic spectacle. Oppenheimer is yet another masterclass filmmaking and storytelling from non other than, Christopher Nolan and he has crafted one of the greatest biopics of all time."
10/10,Arguably Nolan's Masterpiece,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,A cinematic masterpiece in every aspect,07 2023,"Nolan's Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic, at least not the thudding Hollywood variety. Instead it's a movie - a masterful one, among his best - investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers."
10/10,A Biopic Unlike Any You've Seen Before,08 2023,"Oppenheimer is an exceptionally immersive cinematic experience, delving into the life of Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. This dense, three-hour history lesson is at once both an intimate character study and a historical epic on an enormous scale."
7/10,What is the message,08 2023,"This movie missed the opportunity to create something great. I don't understand that in a 3-hours long movie, there wasn't space left for the content of the 2 real war bombs that killed innocent people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 200000+"
10/10,A relentless ride,07 2023,"I need to make two things clear. One, this film is not for everyone and certainly wouldn't appeal to more casual movie goers. It is an in-depth character study of Oppenheimer and is entirely about his life and is not a film about the bomb. If you wanted a thriller about the trinity test this film is not it, they don't start making the bomb until nearly an hour into the film, with the actual test happening with about an hour left of the film. The film isn't particularly exciting either but very interesting and definitely entertaining. It is thought-provoking not action-packed."
6/10,"If you're seeking action, drama and CGI, move on.",08 2023,"I feel somewhat underwhelmed a day after seeing this movie. It's hyped, and I felt myself wanting to enjoy it more. I felt almost as I should enjoy it more, but I found it long, hard work and at times, tough to follow."
1/10,Ridiculously over rated,08 2023,"Went to see this in IMAX last night with my son. He's been wanting to see it since it came out he loves history, I love physics, Engineering, etc. So booked... well with high expectations came huge let downs. The first hour or eternity as it felt was jarring jumping from one time line to another, the acting was adequate but the script was well all over the place. Then came the 2nd hour, now this was the only bit I liked the making of said Bomb. But again the throwing in of just ear breaking noise just to fill in time. Then the last hour we'll this is where I actually fell asleep. It was not needed it was long and boring with very poor acting from all. I really really can't see why people are raving about this. When I saw Nolan was directing I thought great.. wow I was wrong. I left feeling drained but from being utterly bored and let down. I'm still waiting for a decent film to come out something that we haven't had for a number of years now, this was not it."
10/10,What is wrong with this picture?,07 2023,"25 July 2023 Ticket Sales, Rating and Reviews"
9/10,One of the best films of 2023,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is the first film to come from Christopher Nolan's new journey in filmmaking by switching it up a bit to make probably one of the best biopics in the past decade. The story follows J. Robert Oppenheimer on a mission to help develop the atomic bomb that will affect the world as we know it, while also showing us the political dilemma that is caused by it, as well as the affect it has on himself and others close to him. Cillian Murphy as the title character J. Robert Oppenheimer gives probably the best performance of his career as well as one of the best performances of the year and I'm glad that Christopher Nolan finally gives him his time to shine after taking a backseat in Nolan's previous films throughout the years. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer I thought fit her role well, although I wished we could of explored her character a bit more. Matt Damon as General Leslie Grooves Jr is a great addition to the supporting cast and is one of the best characters of the movie. Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss absolutely nails his role and also gives a great supporting performance in this film. Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock was also great, although I felt her role in the film was to be more absurd with Oppenheimer rather than supporting of him like I thought her character would be and I figured her character would of played a bigger role than what was anticipated, but overall, she was fantastic as always. The score for this film is probably one of the best scores I've heard since Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) and the actual atomic bomb scene was incredible to watch. I also like how Christopher Nolan was able to give audiences insight and show how dangerous a atomic bomb can be and the affect it has on people. If there's any cons I have, the way sexuality/nudity is handled is a bit strange, but also I can see why it's handled that way and the third act starts to drag a bit, but other than that, there's not really much to complain about. Overall, Oppenheimer is not only probably one of the best films of 2023, but also one of the best biopics in the last decade that will be revisited for years to come."
10/10,Nolan's Opus,07 2023,"This is the film that cements Christopher Nolan as one of the best contemporary directors working as well as one of the best to ever make movies. From the moment the film starts, it hits the ground running and never lets up. It knows exactly what pace it wishes to set for three hours. There are even moments where you may not be 100% percent sure what is happening, but rest assured it all comes together. See it on the biggest screen you can find. I cannot wait to see this again because I'm sure there are parts that I didn't fully grasp. I might say this is one of the greatest films of all time easily one of the best of the past ten years or so. Go see it - now......"
9/10,INCREDIBLE! INCREDIBLE! INCREDIBLE! [+90%],07 2023,"If you wish to argue in favour of Christopher Nolan being one of the visionary filmmakers of this era with a bunch of people, take them to an IMAX screening of Oppenheimer. After the sci-fi overdose that was Tenet, Nolan chooses to tell the story of the theoretical physicist whose name has nearly become synonymous with the atomic bomb. This is a man who had ambitions of epic proportions, and he had his distinct ways of getting there. The film takes you through significant events in the life of the titular protagonist, told in a non-linear style. It's almost like two parts of a single story running into each other from opposite directions (like a chemical reaction), eventually converging at a pivotal confrontation scene featuring Robert J Oppenheimer, Lewis Strauss, and Albert Einstein. This particular scene carries so much emotional heft when it unfurls at the very end, even when we get to see it play out from another angle early on. And that's just one of many such incredible instances of fantastic storytelling we see in the film!"
10/10,Masterpiece isn't a strong enough word,07 2023,"I originally gave this a 9 because I struggle to give something a 10 but I honestly can't think of a single thing that could be improved or done better. The casting, the editing, the acting, the sound, the pacing... I can't think of a single thing wrong with any of these."
10/10,Cinema Masterpiece,07 2023,"I watched this film in IMAX last night and it was amazing and the ending will shock you. I thought the sound design and cinematography was superb but the acting was even better. Cillian Murphy had a phenomenal performance and Robert Downy Jr. Was very good and stuck to his role. I have seen every single Nolan film, but they way he sees his films layered out is far different then other filmmakers of this generation. Oppenheimer is a brilliant piece of cinema directed by brilliant Christopher Nolan about a brilliant man named Oppenheimer. Yet the realization of the creation of this bomb made me feel scared. Oppenheimer will now not only be known as the man who created the atomic bomb, but the one who is will end the world as we know it. True masterpiece."
7/10,Good but too long and too much dialogue,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
3/10,Beyond Tedious - A Wasted Opportunity,08 2023,"This is one of the most amazing and fascinating stories ever - the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan has chosen not to tell it. Instead, he has adapted the biography 'American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer' by Kai Bird. As chris2004 comments in an Amazon review of that book, 'I was looking forward to this book thinking it might go into the detail of the Manhattan project, the science around how the bomb was made, and Oppenheimer's contribution, as ""father of the bomb"". The book though only spends a brief time reviewing his work at Los Alamos and virtually nothing of his scientific work. Most of the other 500 pages just revolve around his social activities and, later on, the actions of the American Government to determine whether he was a Communist spy. A rather tedious read in the end. I can't imagine how they managed to make this into a film.' Indeed."
10/10,A must see!,07 2023,Cillian Murphy's greatest performance yet and another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Oscars worthy.
9/10,3 hours of talking and I was not bored,07 2023,"Yes, this is a 3 hour movie with 99.9% talking, the other 0.1% is stuff involving bombs or chemical reactions. I would say I was not bored in this movie. I went in knowing its gonna be 3 damn hours, but Nolan did a great job of pacing, the music really helped make this movie not a snooze-fest. Also, do not go in expecting to see explosions and all this war stuff, there is not a single image of war in this film, which is a great choice. Minor spoiler but they don't test the atomic bomb until pass the 2 hour mark."
10/10,Nolan's Magnum Opus,07 2023,"Upon viewing Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the following words come to mind."
10/10,Nuanced Topic that Inspires Thought,07 2023,"This film deserves its own watch, separate from the double feature memes encouraged on social media."
10/10,breathtaking!,07 2023,"I thoroughly enjoyed this breathtaking political thriller (which, in my opinion, is mistakenly marketed as psychological horror movie)! As a form, it is very close to Nolan's 'The Prestige.' The rivalry gradually unfolds, and at the end, we get the whole picture. Best suited for those who have some interest and understanding of the development of Physics during World War II and the political scenario of America at that time. And if you are a lover of good old style drama and Christopher Nolan's work, I think that three hours runtime is not too long for a story of this scale! The story material has potential for a mini-series as well."
6/10,Finely crafted well presented but tiresome?,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Exemplary Movie,07 2023,"Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless."
6/10,Jumbled storytelling but relevant message,07 2023,The screenplay could have been clearer and less confusing. The story should have been told in a linear chronological manner focusing on the creation of the bomb then the communist witch hunt then exoneration. The focus should been less on the interrogation and Robert Downey's character which keeps interrupting the story. Too many characters are introduced and it's hard to keep track of who is who. Should have left out the mistress and the rather gross love scenes. Rather irritating loud strings soundtrack at crucial moments drowns out the dialogue. Typical Nolan. This is unfortunate because the subject matter is fascinating and it does show how scientists helped win WW2.
4/10,"A Documentary,not a movie.",07 2023,All These great work by nolan in the past..The casting was great but the screen play was too dry..I literally feel asleep in the 2nd half. Never ever in my life felt asleep in theatre..It should he considered as a documentary of robert j oppenheimer..It's not an movie.
9/10,Nolan strikes again with a near masterpiece,08 2023,"Christopher Nolan's latest film is a refined, technically superb, and gripping epic, detailing perhaps the most important development in modern human history and the man behind it all."
9/10,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds""",07 2023,"Christopher Nolan is a director admired by many for his several pieces of cinematic art. His films ensure epicness, diversity, depth, and a cinematic experience unlike any other. His perception of filmmaking is the very reason he's admired as one of the most superb directors of our time. His movies are nothing short of masterpieces and Oppenheimer is no exception. His movies being newer than the majority of films by other directors also admired for their brilliant minds within and even outside the realm of filmmaking."
10/10,Awesome,07 2023,"So Oppenheimer didn't disappoint. Prepare for a relentlessly tense three hour investment with ample exposition and borderline horror tropes. Also prepare for a Titanic-style treasure trove of Oscars come award season. Cillian already has one hand on his statue, while Nolan will surely take home Best Film and Director. Downey might also sneak a Best Supporting. But the true master here is Ludwig Goransson, whose score ensures the exposition is never boring, amping up the tension to unbearable levels of dread. Couldn't believe it wasn't Hans Zimmer when I looked it up. Add the unbelievable sound mix and Oppenheimer is terrifyingly unsettling. It has all the hallmarks of classic docudramas like JFK and 13 Days, with MTV editing and time jumps, but is a superior film that must be seen on a big screen, preferably IMAX. Awesome 10/10."
10/10,Christopher Nolan DELIVERS,07 2023,Christopher Nolan Delivered.
10/10,"An Awe-Inspiring Triumph: Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer""",07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional film that deserves the highest praise for its thought-provoking narrative, exquisite craftsmanship, and compelling performances. From the very first frame, the movie draws the audience into the fascinating world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist whose contributions during World War II profoundly altered the course of history."
10/10,Not even a great mind can figure out Humans,07 2023,"It's just astonishing how with such high expectations from everyone, Nolan still manages to deliver this master work, he has been my favorite director for quite some time, and there were many occasions where his films felt unrecognized (not by his peers which ultimately is more important) but by the award community, I hope this year things change."
7/10,I just don't get the love.,08 2023,"The character of J Robert Oppenheimer wasn't only a bit of an SOB, but also very one dimensional and boring."
10/10,One of Nolan's Best Films! Possibly His Best?!,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is the latest film by Christopher Nolan about the legendary J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb. Of all the films coming out this year, this was the one I was most hyped for by a wide margin. I've been hyped for this movie for a couple of years really. Mainly because it's by Christopher Nolan. I have to say, it was worth the wait and hype. I'd say this was Nolan's best film, at least since the Dark Knight."
6/10,Acting is outstanding but the story is dragging,07 2023,"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat."
5/10,Meandering Biography that disappoints.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,One of Christopher Nolan's Best Films,07 2023,"I love when a biopic doesn't play it safe. Having very little knowledge of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, I was very interested in how his studies eventually lead to the creation of the atomic bomb. Being directed by Christopher Nolan, I was already going to check out the film, but it also exceeded my expectations. This is filmmaking in its purest form (especially today). Here's why I believe this excellent film deserves to be seen in theatres."
10/10,A 3-hour magnum opus of incredible storytelling!,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Emotionally charged atomic storytelling triumph.,07 2023,"In the realm of filmmaking history, ""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring and monumental achievement that captivates audiences from the very first moments. The movie delves into a chilling saga of the enduring impact of politics, which can surpass even the horrors of atomic bombings. Director Christopher Nolan, widely known as Chris, masterfully weaves together a complex and thought-provoking story that unfolds through multiple timelines, rendering seemingly ordinary moments into revolutionary conversations - a signature trait that is uniquely Nolan."
10/10,Nolan's One Hit Wonder,07 2023,"I've just witnessed the incredible work of Director Christopher Nolan, who successfully crafted a suspenseful thriller intertwined with a documentary about Robert J. Oppenheimer. I couldn't be more thrilled and amazed by his talent once again. The movie captivates with its fast pace and compelling characters, particularly Oppenheimer, who finds himself questioned in a hearing room, struggling to obtain security clearance."
10/10,I am shaken.. this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word!,07 2023,Oppenheimer is the best movie of the year!
7/10,Good Not Great. Editing and Sound 4 Stars,07 2023,"If you have even a passive interest in the subject or the politics behind the topic, uts a good movie. Casual viewers may get lost."
10/10,A true cinematic event with the most unnerving onscreen explosion ever,07 2023,"I don't really know how to describe a cinematic experience but I think Oppenheimer should be counted as one. You are absorbed into the story, and feel immersed into this world. The movie plays like a thriller slowly revealing new details. Nolan is a master of playing the story non-linearly, but the use of colors contrasting with black and white clearly distinguishes the timeline. We see the lead up to the building of the atomic bomb, and the aftermath. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is just killing it (pun intended), needless to say. I see there is a solid casting and every supporting actor grabs your attention. Even Florence Pugh's small role in the movie is interesting. Emily Blunt's talent is not wasted even with the little screen time she is given. I can say every sensory experience you can get from a movie is fully exploited. The use of sound is very much part of the story, and keeps you feeling anxious throughout. You also feel Cillian's Oppenheimer. I mean Nolan literally bares his character just to show his state of mind and emotion. This is done in various scenes. I could feel the shock Oppenheimer felt when he was cheered on by crowds after learning of the deaths caused by his invention. Whatever emotional journey Oppenheimer is experiencing, I could feel it. I also like how the science is explained simply, and I could grasp the idea of how an atomic bomb works. It was great to see what physicists I had only heard of in name on screen such as Niels Borh, Heisenberg, and most importantly Einstein. It was like the Avengers of geeks, and three hours did not feel long. Robert Downey Jr was brilliant as Lewis Strauss, and I see he channeled a bit of Tony Stark too, but in the unlikable side. Matt Damon was great too, and I like his back and forth with Cillian Murphy. The best part is the explosion scene, and that is worth the wait. I could say they could have ended the movie shortly after the explosion though. Yet, the explosion scene was perfectly executed. It was tense, and showcases the most powerful and unnerving atomic explosion scene in cinema. Nolan perfectly shows how dangerous an atomic bomb is without showing any death, and the impact of it lingers even as the story continues after the explosion. I certainly believe that Oppenheimer will be one of the most important movies of the decade if not of all time. I may even watch it again on the big screen, and yes you do need to watch it on the big screen to fully enjoy it."

3/10,Booooring,09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,"Overwhelming, powerful and emphatic, a film that stays with you",07 2023,"Christopher Nolan's grandly ambitious film about J. Robert Oppenheimer takes on incredible dimensions such that it reaches beyond the contours of the typical Hollywood biopic. This film is also a retelling of America's desperate effort during WW2 to successfully construct a nuclear bomb before the Nazis could. It's also a sobering depiction of America's intense paranoia toward alleged communist sympathizers during the Cold War and beforehand. On both fronts, Nolan's portrayal is remarkably effective."
10/10,Oppenheimer,07 2023,I will reluctantly give it a perfect score even though I think it's the most straight forward Nolan film.
9/10,Modern day masterpiece!,07 2023,"Finally caught the biggest film of the year-Oppenheimer, at the big screen. Christopher Nolan grand biographical, as we all know is about the genius of the same name, and who was instrumental in creating the first nuclear weapons. The film is all about Oppenheimer leading the Manhattan Project under General Groves and in collaboration with a number of great scientists, physicists and others. We might have read/ watched a lot about the bombing of Hiroshima/ Nagasaki, but not many are aware about Oppenheimer's credit and what followed aftermath. Christopher Nolan is a legend of modern-day cinema, and this film only cements his reputation further. He took the basic story of a genius, but layered it with his humane side, his weaknesses, his inner voice in backdrop of world at war, communism, and modern history. The film has parallel tracks of the past and present and they create magic on screen. The enquiry scenes are intriguing and the actual testing scenes are thrilling. The film has great performances, and Cillian Murphy walks tall in the title role. It also has great cameos of other great scientists/physicists/professors of that era-Niels Bohr, Edward teller but it is the scenes featuring Albert Einstein which leaves maximum impact. An awesome film in all departments of storytelling and technicalities, this one is one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in recent years, wherein more focus had been on Marvel kind cinema. The film is heavy on dialogues and uses lot of technical and political terms so is a serious watch without light scenes. Inspite of that and the complex topic if people from all over are loving the film, then it is triumph of Nolan, the team and Oppenheimer himself!"
10/10,M-A-S-T-E-R-P-I-E-C-E,08 2023,"Cinema Is Generally Considered A Source Of Entertainment, But There Are Few Films That Shake You To The Core... Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" Is One Such Film... It's Superbly Crafted, The Characters Are Very Well-Written, All The Actors (Cilian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Conti) Have Given Their Best & Last But Not The Least, It Is Easily One Of The Most Visually Impressive Movies Of All Time... If There's A Definition Of Perfect Anywhere In The World Than This One Completely Satisfies That Definition... It's My Humble Request To Everyone Reading The Review, Please Book Your Tickets & Experience It On The Biggest Screen Possible."
9/10,Compelling storytelling,08 2023,"The story of Oppenheimer and the development of the A-bomb is wonderfully told by Nolan. Nolan uses his non-linear storytelling to great effect, and manages to juggle numerous aspects without getting confusing."
9/10,Warning: Intact attention span required,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is an enthralling character drama concerning the life of Robert Oppenheimer and all of the politics, challenges, and nuances that surrounded his work on the atomic bomb. Aside from an at times thrilling score to make otherwise relatively non-thrilling conversation between characters elevated, the film does not have any big dopamine moments aside from the detonation. All of this said, I was absolutely captivated the entire time. It is important to make this distinction because those with less... refined, attention spans may find it a near impossible task to tolerate 3 hours of this dialogue heavy film. I wish I could have experienced this in 70mm IMAX but digital will have to do."
7/10,The world's longest trailer.,08 2023,"Oppenheimer has phenomenal performances, cinematography and, for the most part, direction. It also has a superb score by Ludwig Görannson (and it has a lot of score, too - 94 minutes of it to be precise). Also, its use of practical effects is staggering. I have no idea how some of the shots were achieved."
10/10,A great piece of film making from a cinematic master.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
6/10,Someone should tell the truth,07 2023,"J. Robert Oppenheimer is a very interesting figure in the history. Therefore, the buzz around this movie is understandable considering one of the biggest director in Hollywood is making the his biographic movie. Nolan is exceptionally talented but he fell in the delusion that his fanbase created. He is really talented behind the camera. The cinematography is amazing. He has a unique eye for crating scenes and framing."
10/10,Astonishing and haunting; Nolan's best film,07 2023,"With his affinity for mind-bending, time-bending action spectacle blending brains and brawn, Christopher Nolan's blockbusters have a dedicated following among cinephiles. For Nolan, no amount of practical affects is too ambitious, no amount of IMAX cameras. I've always been a huge Nolan fan, and while it may sound a bit cliché to say this, films like ""The Dark Knight,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""Inception"" have had a formidable effect on my understanding of film. They taught me how audience expectations from blockbusters can be subverted by a formidable auteur, how action sequences can be combined with a cerebral narrative that conceptually integrates intellectual concepts as the backbone of the storytelling, and how to expect the unexpected from original and creative storytelling. Nolan's new film, ""Oppenheimer,"" may sound a bit more conventional and by-the-numbers than some of his other films, but viewers should rest assured that he has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to keep viewers engaged and thrilled. It is a completely riveting and extraordinarily well-made work that, in my opinion, is Nolan's best film."
8/10,"Nolan has now out-Nolaned himself for the second time in a row, with a different set of minor issues",07 2023,"Even though Oppenheimer is far more cohesive and easy-to-appreciate than the divisive Tenet, the two films still share many Nolanisms: the ticking time-bomb scenario, scientific exposition, an intense, panic attack-inducing soundtrack (this is very much a sound-driven film), non-linear storytelling. How Oppenheimer varies from Tenet, and why it's a better film, has something to do with the acting. Cillian Murphy embodies Oppenheimer to the degree that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, and he's buttressed by an impressive ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr (what might have been...had he not devoted the best years of his life to Marvel), and many others who will certainly look familiar, meriting a visit to the Wikipedia cast list. It even becomes difficult to keep track of all these characters. Oddly enough there is no Michael Caine."
10/10,A masterpiece in every sense of the word.,07 2023,"If you somehow still didn't know Cillian Murphy before watching this film, you'll most certainly never forget him after you've finished. This man has been brilliant in every role he's performed in, but what he accomplished in this film is nothing short of perfection. Christopher Nolan remains the greatest director / filmmaker on the planet, and it's not even close. With the already incredible catalogue he's given us, this just might be his best yet. He makes a 3 hour film feel as if only half an hour has passed. The tension, the love, the scenery, the heartbreak, and the terror.....I mean, it's all there."
9/10,Oscar Race Over for 2023 - Oppenheimer,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself. This film will become known as his greatest work. He blends magnificent set design, compelling dialog, outstanding cinematography, and very fine acting into a lasting biopic masterpiece on the scale of something like Lawrence of Arabia. The Los Alamos sequences are unforgettable."
10/10,Technically Excellent,07 2023,"This was one of the most anticipated films of the year. Because everyone misses Cinema, and great film making. We all know that Christopher Nolan never makes a bad movie, but we still wanted to know how he would tell a story that most people know his way."
7/10,"Too long, but worth seeing",07 2023,"At least 30 minutes could be cut without losing any of the story. The time jumps are confusing, though not as frenetic as in Dunkirk. The story is interesting, and the acting is well done. The film fails the Bechdel test in every way, and is in that regard an anti-Barbie. There are a few female characters, but they only exist to expound the story of men. Kitty especially should have been featured more, rather than a crabby and bitter shell. Why was she so miserable? We can imagine, but would've been great to see her story."
8/10,Movies are back. Packed theater and overwhelming praise for a Christopher Nolan film. Unfortunate it had to be this one.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
7/10,A Good Film. Not Great.,08 2023,'Oppenheimer' could have been great. And here's how. Shave off 30 to 40 minutes. That's it. That's all it would have taken. I don't want to find myself impatient while viewing a film as important as this. Nor do I want to check my watch. More than once. But I did. And did it again. And maybe even a third time.
5/10,Not a visual spectacle. Intense court room drama.,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Just wow !,07 2023,"I consider something masterpiece when it does not let you doubt for a second. The watching experience itself should be so absorbing that you don't even see any shortcomings. Yes later you might think of few. That is what this film is. It totally catches your attention, there is no flashy Hollywood sci-fi, action nothing. It is simple story narrated with excellence. Don't believe all those mocking reviews which say you need to know physics for this, absolutely not. Basic knowledge of science is enough and you get the context of stuff going on but yes you need to pay attention. Don't put your mind on those free refill popcorns and drinks. Narration is really tight. Performances are excellent. Background music as always for Nolan - awesome. I am giving 9 only because I was expecting more from the character of Emily Blunt, she is a wonderful actress, my concern is with the character, it could have been explored little more."
10/10,Beyond anything I have ever experienced in a theater.,07 2023,It has barely been 30 minutes since Ive seen this Masterpiece in the theater (IMAX of course) and am still trying to process it.
8/10,Keeps Nolan In The Game After Tenetisaster,07 2023,"Firstly, I am not a Nolan fan. That means I will not overrate and exagerate his averagely good films. Oppenheimer is a great historical drama not because of its directing but because of its interstellar casting from Downey Jr. To Malek, from Pough to Blunt or From Damon to Affleck. Not to mention Murphy who underacts just perfectly. Just wow... Even extras are famous in this movie..."
8/10,The Man. Who Moved. The Earth.,07 2023,"The rain halts. Scent of dampened soil permeates, soon to be overwhelmed by that of sweat and lumber. Crimson are the signal lights, as if candles ignited for a sacred ritual, guiding all attention to the dark tower. Simple words are spoken, but at the volume of infinity; the music crescendos. Afar, soldiers lay low in postures of worshipping, solemnity in the eyes behind black goggles. The hatted man nods, the hand quivers, the number zeros. There is silence, and then, there is light."
8/10,A Rare Expensive Beast!,07 2023,"I tend to gravitate towards fiction more than fact. Never been a big fan of war, true events or biographies and I wasn't sure about this one, especially with its three hour run time. Besides Dunkirk (skipped it for obvious reasons) I have yet to be disappointed by any of his works and took a chance. Yes, I even liked Tenet..."

Christopher Nolan is a praised director, and while I'm not some super fan, I have liked the films of his I have seen. That and we had some amazing actors: Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, what could go wrong? Well..."
8/10,Bravado Mr Nolan.,07 2023,"This film is magnificent. In the hands of a lesser director I think this would have been average and a bit of a snorefest -potentially. Nolan never lets this happen with astounding score, crackling dialogue , flawless acting and the typical Nolan direction. There is never a dull moment. Also there's a real element of suspense/ tension that Nolan exudes which makes this biopic feel more like a suspenseful drama but never swaying away from documenting the self titled life story. If the film had ended at the bombing I think I would have given this one less star but the last 40 minutes post bombing is riveting cinema and elevates it to almost greatness. Is this Nolan's best film? Not for me but is never the less a fantastic achievement."
10/10,Oppenheimer,07 2023,"I gave it 10/10 because the movie made me shook with the explosion of knowledge, of truth, of the realness."
10/10,Cinema is its most visceral form,07 2023,"It's rare to experience a movie like Oppenheimer in the contemporary Hollywood. This is Nolan at his best, using his experience in ways you'd never imagine."
8/10,Not the Bomb; Good Entertainment,07 2023,"This is a slow-burn grown-up movie that doesn't rely on CGI, swooshes and/or thuds to make us think we're watching something good. The science seems to be lacking (Oppie was a scientist), but this is a biography, not a Manhattan project development tale (read Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" for that). And given this, so is missing a thorough character development of the protagonist. In the end, we know he succeeded yet cannot pinpoint just how that happened: we know that Groves, aptly played by Damon, was outrageously difficult for a scientist to deal with. The IMAX format was not necessary as the visuals/sets don't get a boost from it. It just has no grand visual elements. But the story and subject matter held my attention. Blunder: I was sorry to (not) see a proper epilogue noting the very recent posthumous reinstatement of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Costuming was poor: 1940s men always wore hats and shirts that were (only) white. Aside from hairstyles (and period autos) the piece felt too modern. Truman's Whitehouse was quite authentic. But it does what a flick is supposed to do: entertain! 8/10."
8/10,Oppenheimer - A Fast Paced History Movie (with an extreme long runtime),07 2023,"I've honestly never been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I will admit that I haven't seen a lot of his more popular movies (with the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy). From what I know about Nolan's work is how unique the editing is in his films, and you can kinda tell from the odd editing choices, specifically when Oppenheimer would hallucinate. While I do see how that kind of style can better develop Oppenheimer's character by visually showing us how he is feeling, I can see how this can be bothersome to some people. Personally, I really enjoyed it."
6/10,Its a lot....,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,One of the best movies ever made !,07 2023,This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life so far.
6/10,Should be great but is boooooring!,08 2023,This should not have been a 3 hour movie.
5/10,Highly overrated,07 2023,This must be the most overrated film of the year.
9/10,A Promethean Epic,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan, one film on from ""Tenet"", shows once again how skilfully he can bring mythological and complex scientific themes into the realm of cinematic glory."
10/10,Simply marvelous film making and acting,07 2023,The skills of each of the actors plus bringing this skill out of them onto to the big screen by the man with the golden movie ticket (pun intended) Christopher Nolan is very commendable.
9/10,A Dark Merlin,07 2023,"Oppenheimer: The Manhattan Project is central to this film but it is also about how Oppenheimer's intellectual development, his life and loves. Cillian Murphy is devastating in his portrayal of the great scientist whose mind was wracked with strange thoughts of the stars and of the Quantum World, a womaniser, drinker, chain smoker. Great luminaries like Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Nils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Einstein (Tom Conti) have walk on parts or cameos. The Einstein cameo proves to be central to the films narrative though. The film unfolds through two hearing and Oppenheimer's career progression on to being Director of the Manhattan Project. The hearing on Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954 shows how he was deserted by many friends and colleagues but also uncovers the Iago behind this assault on his integrity. In ways Oppenheimer was his own worst enemy, careless in his choice of friends and too quick to make enemies. There are too many characters to cover in any one review but Emily Blunt puts in a creditable performance as Kitty Oppenheimer, having to hold things together, putting her life as a botanist on hold. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) stood by Oppenheimer in 1954 but their relationship is portrayed as being stormy during the Los Alamos years, fights over security clearances for other scientists and even Oppenheimer himself due to past political associations. We even get to see Oppenheimer's involvement in unionising scientists. Even though we know the outcome the tension builds as the Trinity Test approaches. Fermi (Danny Deferrari) makes book on how may kilotonnes the explosion will be with a side bet on the atmosphere igniting. A tale of victory, betrayal but also of how scientists had differing opinions on the use of atomic weapons and the post war use of atomic energy. The two hearings head towards a conclusion just as the Manhattan Project does, all three resulting in different levels of destruction. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 9/10."
10/10,Easily the Greatest Film of the Year,07 2023,"Being a Chris Nolan film, my expectations were already through the roof for Oppenheimer. With a star-studded cast, it was set up for greatness. With this in mind, it actually exceeded my expectations. The acting, emotional impact, writing, music score, pacing, cinematography checked off all the boxes. I could talk about these concepts for hours, but I'll elaborate about what was most prominent."
10/10,Academy Awards written allover,07 2023,"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music."
10/10,Nolan's best yet,07 2023,Oppenheimer is a monumental cinematic achievement by Christopher Nolan! A deep dive character study(biopic) into a man who historically changed the world forever and how masterfully crafted!
6/10,Jumpy and loud.,08 2023,The movie takes a reasonably interesting look at Oppenheimers life and work. It uses the most part of its 3 hours runtime focusing around two periods of Oppenheimers life: the time in Los Alamos and the time around the hearing for the renewal of his security clearance. The latter one is the anchor from which the movie jumps around the other timeframes.
10/10,Deserving of the Highest Praise.,07 2023,"It's now over 24 hours since the end credits rolled but I find myself still thinking about all the great things I loved about this movie. Often when leaving the cinema you're on a high when you have had a good experience it's very easy to be over enthusiastic about how good something is. In this case, having had that time to reflect I cannot fault this film in any way, nor any of the cast on their performances."
6/10,Surprisingly boring,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Not about the Bomb!,07 2023,"I entered the movie theatre expecting a great movie about the nuclear bomb and its impact on Oppenheimer, but no, it was actually about Oppenheimer and his impact on himself and the world around him."
8/10,Oppenheimer,07 2023,"A brilliant film from master director Christopher Nolan, whose catalogue of unforgettable movies continues to grow."
10/10,Excellent Movie,07 2023,"It's a great movie ... it's not just about him making US nuclear power & world war 2 .., it's more about the human aspect , the way he was thinking after nagasaki and hiroshima attacks."
10/10,Claiming a bright spot in Cinema History!,07 2023,"Heart pounding, adrenaline rush, breathtaking, mind-blowing...this is how it felt watching this movie for 180 minutes."
9/10,Rami Malek 😂,07 2023,Wow. This film...Is just wow.
6/10,Boring,08 2023,"As a devoted fan of historical dramas and biographical films, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated Oppenheimer movie. With its intriguing premise centered around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb, I expected a captivating exploration of complex moral dilemmas and intellectual pursuits. Unfortunately, the film fell short of my expectations, leaving me rather bored and underwhelmed."
7/10,Lacking Nolans Cinematography,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a decent film about an important subject that gets bogged down with minor politics, we also have the nolan cut... But a nolan cut with a poor pay off."
2/10,They found a way to make a nuclear bomb boring.,07 2023,"As a science nerd and someone who used to be obsessed with the Manhattan project, nuclear bombs etc. This really couldn't have been much worse. There were maybe 15 minutes of interesting tidbits related to themes Oppenheimer actually dealt with in his life and the rest was just garbage. It's like they tried to make it into a romcom/political film that had very little to do with the actual interesting parts of Oppenheimer's life. I won't write spoilers, but I promise you there is not much to spoil. Endless drivel, dialog that literally put me to sleep for a few minutes."
10/10,Nolan's Magnum Opus,08 2023,"Christopher Nolan has once again proven his mastery of storytelling and visual prowess with his latest film ""Oppenheimer."" This film is an extraordinary exploration of one of history's most complex and enigmatic figures, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Nolan's brilliant direction has brought his story to life in a truly remarkable way."
10/10,Well done cast and crew,07 2023,"Everything about this film is top notch: acting, lighting, sound, dialogue, everything worked perfectly telling a very technical and detailed story. Well done."
10/10,Best movie of the year,07 2023,"This movie is worth the whole hype. The acting is phenomenal, Cillian Murphy was outstanding and how the history construct is amazing."
9/10,Imagining the unimaginable,08 2023,"Christopher Nolan is a difficult guy to work with. He is a principled filmmaker, despises 3D and avoids CGI as much as possible. Yet his movies are anything but traditional. Throughout his career, he showed an exceptionally masochistic pleasure in challenging himself with complex and ambitious scripts--sometimes too complex and ambitious for his own good. In a way, he is like the title character of his latest biopic ""Oppenheimer"". I feel like if he and the man himself would have met each other they'd be good friends."
10/10,"Beautiful, spectacular, tense, emotional, even better than I expected..",07 2023,"Beautiful, spectacular, tense, emotional, even better than I expected.. probably one of the best and most accurate docu-drama-movies ever."
6/10,"Decent, not great",07 2023,"One of the most anticipated movies, because of the man behind it, happent to know the story before going into movie. Frankly, the movie feels stretched, wanted to just leave the theatre about 2 hrs in, but stayed in respect of those 2 hrs. Legal proceedings just such a bore, shouldn't have been given this much significance, just flooded the movie, also I wasn't confident about where his wife's motivation comes from. For the first time ever I noticed this style of movie making that is present in this movie actually bothers me. Whole movie divided into 5-10 seconds scenes, what is it Mr. Nolan, don't trust your viewers to have longer attention spans?"
10/10,Shall we hand over all Oscars now!,08 2023,"Theres very few movies that have an impact on cinema like this one will. The star studded cast, direction, story and the other very pink opponent releasing on the same day. There are trends that Hollywood will try and manufacture unlike this freak chance of these movies being released on the same day. I truly hope that the film industry are taking note of true storytelling, heart and classic film making with little to none enhancements to the moments that truly matter."
7/10,I went in seeing a quote that people were silent after the film.,08 2023,"This is my first IMAX experience. Boy 'o' boy, I loved how sound just pours into the theatre. However, I didn't think the film was great. Even, I was silent after the film. It was because, I didn't like the film much and the end credits made me think about the money that I spent to experience the film. I could've got grocery with it. People near me were occasionally snoring or playing with each other. Seeing the **x scene on that big screen made some near me breath heavily. Positives about the film would be Nolan's ability to execute the story in a fairly non-boring way, the awesome sound (maybe it's an IMAX effect), and an opportunity to see Cillian's craft in an up close manner. I liked his character in Peaky Blinders and in this you're able to see that he has put more work into it, from TV Screen to Big Screen requires that commitment and he has done it. A pro like Robert's acting was also relevant, however this kind of acting is nothing new to him. Emily's role seemed to be an overrated one, I don't know why they did it, maybe to show her in a special light, I don't know. I would like to see Cillian in a western-rancher kind of film, just to see how it would turn out."
10/10,I'm gonna keep it super simple. This is cinema.,07 2023,"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER."
9/10,Damn near perfect!,07 2023,"Fanf***ingtastic! From start to finish. Absolutely loved every second of this incredible movie! Runtime clocks in at 3 hours but it went by very smoothly because there is so much going on. For those wondering, yes you can just dive right in. There's nothing you need to watch to understand what is going on. In fact, other than my time in school the only other times I've heard of any of the scientists in this movie were from the times they were mentioned on the popular tv sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Nolan is one of my favorite directors. His storytelling style may not be for everyone. So far I've loved each of his movies. Nolan joins a very short list of Directors that I don't need a bunch of anything to get me to watch their next story. Nolan has a very unique way in how he presents to you his stories. This one is no different. This movie is shot beautifully, and the practical set in Los Alamos really brought the scenes to life. It is amazing that Nolan was able to do all of this with the use of practical effects and little to no CGI. Let's talk about the music. The music adds elements of horror and intensity throughout. As a matter of fact, throughout the movie my Apple Watch kept going off because my heart rate had spiked high. That's how intense certain scenes got. Every actor in this movie brought their A game. There was such a great balance between all of them. I did like how a little bit of the movie felt like Seven Samurai and this is shown in the Trailer where Oppenheimer and General Groves go out and start recruiting scientists for this amazing, impossible task. I saw this movie in Dolby. Last time Nolan had a movie out I watched it in every format because I couldn't get enough and Oppenheimer is going to be no different. I look forward to watching this in IMAX once I'm able to get a seat. Great flick!"
10/10,Quite possibly the best Nolan movie.,07 2023,"In Nolan's filmography, which very few directors in history can rival, OPPENHEIMER possibly stands out as the best, and certainly most pure form of cinema. Give Cillian Murphy the Oscar NOW."
10/10,One of THE best film in cinema history!!!!!,07 2023,Christopher Nolan never again disappoints me with all the films he made. But this one is the real deal. Give this man an award for best picture and best director and screenplay. Give Cillan Murphy an award for best actor in leading role. I saw give everyone that worked very hard well on this masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is all I can for everyone who is a big fan of Christopher Nolan films. The IMAX 70MM MUST SURVIVE AND PREVAIL. It is better to watch the film in the best IMAX 70MM FORMAT POSSIBLE. No one and I meant no has ever witnessed this film before.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9/10,Couldn't take my eyes off the screen,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,A ridiculous achivement in filmmaking.,07 2023,"I had a high expectation for this one since not only Chris Nolan is directing but also my favourite actor Cillian is playing the lead role. When I watched this film those expectations were not only met but also exceeded. You really get into the head of Oppenheimer in the film. This one really is more about Oppenheimer than it is about the atomic bomb. This movie even though 3 hours long, will not keep you away. It has kept me engaged throughout. Editing, dialogues, cinematography and especially acting are on top. There is no questioning about Nolan's direction. That detonation scene though, it is hard to put it in words. I mean you have to experience it in big screens. I am glad watched this in IMAX. Absolutely brilliant. For me this is the BEST FILM EVER MADE."
6/10,It was okay probably not worth the extra cost to watch in iMAX,07 2023,What went well:
8/10,The Power To Destroy The World,07 2023,"Me and a few of my friends saw Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" on opening night, in the IMAX format for which this film was intended. The feeling I have after having watched this film is something I can't really describe, nor do I know how I feel about the film as a whole. I feel as if this movie doesn't directly try to tell you whether or not Oppenheimer was a good or bad person, but allows one to decide this for their own. Same with the dilemma of building such a weapon of mass destruction."
6/10,Mid,07 2023,"This movie is like if Terrence Mallick remade interstellar. It feels like the worse Nolan movie from a major studio. Watching it gave the experience of watching a three hour trailer. The non-linear storyline was interesting, and the movie is beautiful from a technical filmmaking standpoint but the story felt tired. The majority of the acting performances are top notch, with one exception, Emily Blunt, bless her heart is very inconsistent and stands out as the bottom of this illustrious class. By the end of the film I was waiting for the end card and this longing was not helped by the all too common terrible theater educate."
3/10,O God.,07 2023,"Nolan is gifted at writing in such a way that characters say much yet in fact say nothing. Nolan's addicted to showing the story out of sequence, and sometimes it works, but it's just overkill now. Thank God for Mr. Nolan, because without his genius we wouldn't know the limits of our eardrums."
10/10,It's a lot,07 2023,"Oppenheimer (2023) is a lot. I feel like that's the best way to describe this movie. Obviously, all the performances were absolutely incredible, especially from Cillian Murphy, R. D. J, and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer takes even mundane scenes to the most tense possibility. You'll probably feel the same in the seconds leading up to the Trinity test as you feel watching Cillian Murphy sit in a chair in the background while everyone else talks, it's that tense. It's also incredibly melancholic, the movie ends where you expect it to but the revelations and connections back to the beginning are perfectly executed. Oppenheimer was an incredibly complex individual and while the movie does want you to root for him it also showcases many of his shortcomings throughout his life. The Trinity test itself is beautiful in an eerie way and what follows is even more interesting. The dialogue is spot on and the sound mixing is insanely well done which is a big step up from Nolan's other movies. Definitely a must-see in IMAX. Almost perfect except for the sex scenes, especially the one during the interview, which were so out of place and made my whole theater uncomfortable. (9/10)"
10/10,J. Robert Oppenheimer The Martyr,07 2023,"A movie that has a poetic description of the life of Robert Oppenheimer. When you do a favour for your own country, but not for the humanity. "" No good deed goes unpunished""."
9/10,The tragic story of a genius doomed by his discovery,08 2023,"Christopher Nolan narrates in this drama the rise and fall of the physicist Robert Oppenheimer, author of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is a good movie with an interesting story about this physicist who rose to fame for creating a powerful destructive weapon, but after taking several lives it left him with a feeling of remorse that haunted him for the rest of his life. It is a well written and directed movie with acceptable performances. Of course, due to the 3 hours duration and the amount of dialogues it has, it can be heavy. The entire film recounts the process of creating the bomb during World War II and how Oppenheimer later had to deal with serious charges and incriminations after opposing the use of his discovery for military purposes. It is a story of a man who discovered something powerful, but in the wrong hands it could be dangerous to many human lives. In many respects it is a tragic story of a prodigious genius who was cursed by his discovery. Oppenheimer is a fascinating historical film about the mind behind one of the most catastrophic events in human history and how this brilliant mind was doomed by it. My final rating for this movie is 9/10."
8/10,Christopher Nolan Magic on Show,07 2023,"I was intrigued to see what Christopher Nolan could do with a biopic about an important if perhaps little known figure from history. I vaguely knew the story but still learnt a lot. Give a theoretical physicist an unlimited budget, a tight deadline and get him to beat the Germans and Russians in turning theory into a real, working ""experiment"" which would quite simply change the course of history forever. Not a bad challenge."
10/10,Intellectually Stimulating,07 2023,"If you're going into this movie with the expectation of being entertained by lots of explosions, comedy, and filler screen time, you will be disappointed. This is a visual story. Its very intellectually created & exceptionally well timed out. Given that it's a 3 hour movie it does a wonderful job allowing the viewer to build a relationship with the main character to fully understand Oppeinheimers trials and tribulations and to understand what motivated him & shaped what would later become his viewpoint on the entire creation of the atomic bomb and overall criticism of the US Military's decisions. Another 10/10 for C. Nolan!"
10/10,My favorite Christopher Nolan movie,07 2023,"Experiencing a lot of emotions after walking out of the theatre. Anger after the final shots, then after 5 minutes of talking with people a feeling of love and admiration for this film and what it achieves. More truth about how the world works than anything I've ever seen. Greatest use of montage and music. Amazing editing. My favorite Christopher Nolan movie. It scared me. Some scenes are horrifying and literally shake you to your core especially with a powerful imax theatre."
7/10,A potentially brilliant film spoilt by too much and too loud background music,08 2023,"It was difficult to hear all the dialogue as the background music drowned out most of the spoken word. I am therefore looking forward to the DVD release so I can watch it again - with the sub titles turned to ON! I also expect the cut scenes that didn't make the movie to help explain some of 'in my opinion' the missing links to the story. I considered it should have covered more detail about 'the bomb' and its development. I'm sure there will be many Oscar nominations from the film including Best Film, Best Leading Actor and Best Supporting Actor in Matt Damon but certainly not Sound!!! Overall - very disappointing. Oh, I forgot, an Oscar nomination for Ludwig Goransson for his music as it dominates the movie."
8/10,180 minutes - Destroyer of running time,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a great film. The cast is stellar , the cinematography is top notch, and the sound editing might be the most underrated aspect of all. The theme of annihilation associated with the nuclear arms race still resonate today. The only issue was the running time of 3 hours. I felt the film could have been just as effective if it shaved off about 45 minutes. There is a lot of time devoted to a hearing to determine whether Oppenheimer gets to retain his security clearance. This may be an effective way to tell a story but the stakes of the ""trial"" never felt that high. Similarly there is confirmation hearing for the Secretary of Commerce played by Robert Downey Jr. That is simply not very interesting when compared to the high stakes development and testing of the nuclear bomb."
6/10,"Too Long, Too Confusing, A disparate mess",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
4/10,Spoiler Alert: The Bomb Worked,07 2023,"One scene in ""Oppenheimer"" kept my interest: the test detonation of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's skill as a director of action set pieces that he was able to make this moment almost unbearably suspenseful. After all, it's not exactly a spoiler to reveal that the test works."
9/10,Careful What You Wish For,07 2023,Is Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer destined to be one of the best movies ever?
10/10,Must watch! Absolutely phenomenally done.,07 2023,"The movie is incredible. I love how they started from the beginning not just starting at making the a-bom. It was very interesting to watch his life and everything that happened. The visuals and the actors are phenomenal. I already had so much respect for Cillian Murphy, but hell this man can act. He was amazing and I loved RDJ as Strauss and Emily Blunt as Kitty. They were all so good! If you are like me and like your history stuff then you already know how it ends. But even though I knew, my eyes were locked on the screen, I was nervous, I was angry, I was sad, I felt relieved. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and I am glad that I had them. I know this movie isn't for anyone because 3 hours is a long sit, but for me it didn't even feel like 3 hours. I absolutely loved it, best actors, best cinematography, best music, best writing. I can go on forever. Go see this, it's a very interesting and big part of history and an incredible made movie."
10/10,A masterpiece,08 2023,"This movie is a masterpiece for which I still have hope for movies. I did not blink the whole 3 hours. Have to watch it again. And again. Acting is exceptional, Murphy especially delivers human nature and emotions on a whole new level, and some scenes keep you on edge of your seat. Truly one of the best movies I have ever watched. I feel like I have to watch it a few more times because there are so many details and emotions you can easily miss if you just blink for a second. Can't wait to see it again. Please make this kind of movies more. Smart, educating, and worth my time and money. Thank you."
9/10,Flawed and complicated people create a flawed and complicated history.,07 2023,"Oppenheimer Review: Very good movie, but be forewarned: it's long (3 hours) and very dialogue-heavy. People who aren't interested in history, who are distracted very easily, and who expect a lot of action will be disappointed. Every movie-making and storytelling aspect hit the mark. The cinematography, the musical score, the depth of characterization were all good. I only have one criticism, which is that the jumbled chronology of scenes made it kind of confusing for someone who wasn't paying attention or for someone who didn't have a basic knowledge of the story. However, the black and white shots coupled with the various location settings helped with this. Overall, an excellent film with a very important message: History is made by flawed and complicated people, who sometimes do bad things for good reasons, which can have both rewarding and terrible effects."
9/10,Another jewel added to Nolan's crown,07 2023,Is Oppenheimer a triumph in filmmaking?
9/10,"Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, yes. But it could have been better.",09 2023,"Oppenheimer is a masterpiece brilliantly directed by Nolan, with a breathtaking performance by Cillian Murphy. But it could have been better. Personally, I found that there were some unnecessary scenes (you will know which ones), and that the film missed more minutes of female performances (the movie is 99% male), especially having a wonderful actress as Emily Blunt, which Nolan gave her maybe 10 minutes tops in 3 hours (and 2 minutes speaking). The two main women who appear (both brilliant in real life): Kitty Oppenheimer (who was a biologist and a botanist) and Jean Tatlock (a psychiatrist) appear respectively as a hysterical drunken, and a pure object. And that's a pity. I also think that Nolan could have add some images about the Holocaust too (or, at least, of WWII, both very relevant to the movie). There are some annoying anachronisms: Germans in the 40s were no ""Nazis"", but ""Germans"" (the Germans were trying to build an atomic bomb, not the ""Nazis""; the USA was at war with Germany, not with the ""Nazis""; the allies were at war with Germany, Italy and Japan; period). All the quantum mechanics parts in the movie are truly fascinating; still, you don't learn anything, and that's a missed opportunity. As I mentioned, Cillian Murphy's performance is absolutely outstanding. Robert Downey Jr. Is surprisingly brilliant. The music of the film (Ludwig Goränsson -not Hans Zimmer this time) is absolutely gorgeous, and Nolan's imprint is everywhere. If you like Nolan, you will love this movie. 9/10."
6/10,3 hours of bleak exposition,08 2023,"I'm a scientist and an engineer, with a healthy respect for history. Surely there could be hardly any fewer more important topics than this movie."
10/10,Perfect,07 2023,"A spectacular film, one of the best motion pictures that was ever shot. The soundtrack of the movie was insane, it is three hours but you don't feel it because it is exciting from the start till the end, the cast was amazing, everyone of them did his role with perfect performance. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job directing Oppenheimer. The way he tells the story of doctor Robert was fantastic, they were able to make everyone in the theater so excited throughout the movie which is mainly focusing on politics without any action scenes and that's really incredible. I believe that this movie is the best cinema experience in history."
6/10,The Fallout of Modern Biopics,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Three nail-biting hours,07 2023,"When you see Oppenheimer, what catches your attention is how a three-hour film full of dialogue is so long and doesn't get boring. The wonderful Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer, and the good thing about the film is that instead of being about the atomic bomb, it is about Oppenheimer himself."
8/10,"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds 8/10",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Extraordinary,07 2023,"Title: A Critical Review: Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"""
10/10,Fastest 3 hours of my life,07 2023,"By far Christopher Nolan's best written movie to date! Oh man just the dialogue alone gets you going. You add in these new crispy black and white IMAX scenes. Such a fun movie with so much anticipation. The characters are all so layered and all the actors do a fantastic job (kudos to casting.) Fastest 3 hours for a movie experience I'm still waiting for Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon, but this is the front runner for best picture. I have so much respect for Christopher Nolan not just as one of the best film makers of all time, but just being loyal. I would be shocked if Cullen Murphy does not win the Oscar this year. Still a few more movies to come out but this was a damn good movie! Great time for cinema! At least 4 great movies in theaters right now. Please go out and support!"
7/10,A Masterpiece but overrated and overhyped - You need to set your expectations beforehand,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,"Egregious but not the best Nolan. Cillian Murphy morphs into the character, an amazing cast, brilliant cinematography",07 2023,"This is a love letter to science and scientists. At times it reminded me of the recurrent joke in ""The Big Bang Theory"" about Howard not being a real scientist since he ""only"" holds a PhD in Engineering. I was a bit disappointed with the sound but it might be an artistic choice. Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts. I would recommend it in a double bill with ""Hiroshima Mon Amour""."
6/10,"Better than Tenet, I guess?",07 2023,"Not great, not terrible. A whole hour too long. Too convoluted, no clear through line. Same problem Nolan started having with Dunkirk and Tenet, no real character development or motivations. Yes, Oppenheimer ""states"" his reasons for being interested in quantum mechanics and then the bomb, but it's just that. Telling, not showing. A lot of back story happens off screen. Ugh."
3/10,Nolan's style is not for this kind of story,07 2023,"The story is simply not for Nolan. He did great with Inception, Interstellar, Memento, Batman, but the A-Bomb story is not the right material for his style storytelling."
8/10,A Stunning Return to Form from one of Hollywood's Greatest Directors.,07 2023,"I've been a big Christopher Nolan fan for a while (surprising, considering I'm a film bro, I know), but can't help but feel most of his offerings in the 2010s have been...in my opinion, weaker than his previous work. For me, films like Dunkirk and Tenet come off as cold nd lifeless, more interested in intricate film making than telling a compelling story. Nolan seems to actively want to alienate the audience with these movies. Interestellar and The Dark Knight Rises, on the other hand, almost feel too sentimental, betraying Nolan's characteristic fixation on logical storytelling for endings that seem like studio encouraged ""feel good"" endings that aren't necessarily earned."
8/10,"""I am become death the destroyer of worlds""",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Bombastic cinema experience,07 2023,"Witnessing the Oppenheimer was like walking between the two worlds, one is idealistic and genius while the other is a lasting nightmare where the consequences and actions sit on one man's heavy shoulders."
10/10,"Thank you, Nolan!",08 2023,"Nolan is my favorite director, second to none. I just love all his movies and I don't think there is a bad movie in his CV."
10/10,Another Nolan Masterclass of a Film!,07 2023,"First off, please please go see and support this film!"
6/10,A possible bomb about a bomb.,07 2023,I think we're getting used to Christopher Nolan's movie making style now.
10/10,Fantastic,07 2023,"This movie touched every base and was very well written. It answered so many questions I've had even after visiting the museum several times and with my husband working for the labs himself, I'm even more proud and astonished at all of the history Los Alamos has given. Very interesting, brilliant and sad."
6/10,Not what I expected. Definitely not IMAX worthy .,08 2023,"From the trailer and marketing of this movie, I was led to believe this was going to be a visual spectacle and a movie made for cinema. A lots of technical details of its making was promoted, including the fact it was shot on film using an expensive imax camera rather than digitally. As a result, I decided to see it in an IMAX cinema paying about 60% more than the regular ticket price. However, it turned out to be more of a political drama discussing Oppenheimer's political views and his clashes with bureaucrats. I was wrong to believe it was about the exciting story of Manhattan project. Although some people said this is a movie made to save cinemas from streaming services (like Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible - which is definitely a movie made for cinemas), I do not think you should necessarily go to the cinema to enjoy it. It is not a bad movie but watching it on TV should suffice given the fact it is more of a drama and there is not many visually stunning scenes you would expect from the trailer."
10/10,A Masterpiece in a sea of pseudo-movies,07 2023,"I would just like as an amateur to express my deepest sympathy for this movie, the purpose, the meaning, the goal and the courage to present complexity, politics and history to disinterested young people, wich unfortunately seem to go deeper and deeper to the futile ignorance of existing in comfort. This is a complex watch, does not align with modern culture and doesn't fear truth, it is not made for masses or public popularity."
10/10,Oscar worthy film and performances,07 2023,"Exceptional. One of Christopher Nolan's best movies. The cinematography is immaculate. The scenes are so crisp and intricate; can't believe they didn't use CGI. The cast, Cillian Murphy in particular, deserves an Oscar for that performance. In my opinion, the supporting roles of RDJ and Emily Blunt are also Oscar worthy, not to mention the spectacular portrayal by Matt Damon. The pacing, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and story line exceeds expectations. This accurately paints a vivid picture of Oppenheimer's life and who he was. I think this film has a very good chance of being nominated and winning best picture at the Oscars next year. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible. A movie you won't regret seeing."
10/10,The Man Who Changed The World and Cinema,07 2023,A man who would forever change the world. This story is masterfully presented to us by Nolan in a biopic opera style film that is one of the most brilliant character studies that feels larger than life.
10/10,A will forever remember the first time I watched Oppenheimer,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan returns to the big screen with a 100 million dollar budget and raises the bar for biographies, historical war dramas and cinema in its entirety. With an A-list celebrity cast, Oppenheimer delivers in every possible aspect. From cinematography to screenplay to sound editing, it is clear that this project was done with meticulous attention to detail and with an intense passion for the art of cinema."
8/10,the destroyer of worlds,07 2023,"It's only the middle of summer and we are almost half a year before the Academy nominations, but I think we already have one of the serious contenders for collecting many of the 2024 awards in Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer'. It's the kind of movies adored by American audiences and critics alike, the story of a great American adventure and the biography of a personality who made history. The biographical docu-drama brings to the screen the life story of the scientist who led the Manhattan Project and raises questions relevant then and relevant today about the responsibilities of scientists and the risks of research and technological achievements put at the service of militaries and governments. The cast features an impressive gallery of Hollywood stars, and the special effects sprinkled throughout the film give it an extra dimension of appeal (and a Nolan touch). There are also plenty of political drama aspects, but ultimately the main qualities of this film, the ones that will remain after the initial excitement wears off, are related to the extremely truthful and well-documented portraits of the personalities who contributed to the success of the Manhattan Project."
7/10,Don't be confused like I was,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,"Not Your usual Nolan movie but a Tale of Science, Politics, and Cinematic Excellence",07 2023,"I loved the movie. It was an amazing watch at least for me. I won't be biased as I cannot call myself a fan of Nolan though I have liked most of his previous works. But to begin with, this is not a typical Christopher Nolan movie. His earlier movies were more into visual appeals and how he captured the panoramic and action sequences. Such scenes allow the director to experiment and come up with breathtaking scenes for the visual hunger of the audience which worked in Nolan's flavor, although, although, here comes the mastery of his work, as the movie Oppenheimer was not his typical action, thriller, adventure genre of movie where he could use his already hit templates, rather this was a plain biographical movie and his usual hit template had no use in it. The movie demanded something else, which was never Nolan's forte or maybe we weren't shown as such, with Oppenheimer Nolan showcases what he is capable of, which is, he is capable of pulling up a thriller cinematic experience out of a rather normal biographical movie on life of a physicist. He did not use any of his previous templates but rather focussed mainly on the dissection of the character of not just Oppenheimer but also people involved in his life. The colours of the characters one by one appeared in front of you just as layers of onion appear and the final colours of the characters when juxtaposed made the movie come out in flying colours. This was a rather perfect example of how direction and storytelling can engross the audience so much in a movie as if you are living someone else's life. This 3-hour movie was a piece of artwork and for me is the piece de resistant of Christopher Nolan."
7/10,Visually stunning but somewhat... breathless,07 2023,"Based on the 700-page tome ""American Prometheus"", Christopher Nolan's three-hour biographical thriller about the 'father of the atomic bomb', J. Robert Oppenheimer, is no less of an epic."
1/10,Don't believe high star ratings are real.,08 2023,"Don't believe high star ratings are real. Oppenheimer movie was a major disappointment, was looking forward to seeing it because of the hype, I learned my lesson. This movie was a snooze fest, I saw many sleeping on their reclining chairs. To add to boredom most of the movie had constant ""elevator music"" in the background while people were talking, that made it hard to understand what they were saying, even with my perfect hearing. The movie kept jumping from scene to scene was very hard to follow and after a while one does not care, too much effort to follow when the headache kicks in. So many are saying the movie is too long, correction it's the same length as The Godfather, nobody says The Godfather was too long, the truth is that Oppenheimer movie bored us to death."

10/10,Grabs you and won't let go,08 2023,"A film like Oppenheimer can easily be regarded as a well made film, but is not for everyone. Rating it based on filmmaking, then it's a 10 and that's where I will stay personally, too. Certainly there are things that could be changed to ""make it better"", but the decisions that were made by Nolan were the correct ones narratively."
9/10,"If you're a Science Geek, its not for you",07 2023,"Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl."
10/10,"Masterpiece, if you understand what you are in for",07 2023,Going into watching oppenheimer many people felt disappointed because of the court scenes. This is the story of OPPENHEIMER. Not the story behind the a bomb or the manhattan project. Yes that plays a huge part into the life and story of oppenheimer but so does everything that happened after which dramatically effected his life.

My best friend had done Barbenheimer a few days before and told me to watch Oppenheimer before Barbie, but I'm starting to deeply regret that decision. Oppenheimer was so incredible that the bar was set tens of thousands of kilometres into the sky, which probably made me enjoy Barbie much less than I would've on it's own. I was still processing this masterpiece even when all the Kens went to all out beach war."
10/10,Experience of a lifetime,07 2023,This was genuinely without a doubt the first movie I witnessed that made experience and sink away and forget everything around me.
9/10,Excellent experience,08 2023,"Finally a movie worth seeing, in the contemporary, desolate landscape. After the ""faux pas"" of Tenet, Nolan delivers again a great movie."
9/10,An incredibly important movie,08 2023,"So much has been written here about the brilliance of Cillian Murphy and the ensemble cast, about the cinematography, editing, sound track. And I concur it is a brilliant move on those fronts though a tad too long and heavy in lengthy dialogues in early stages.. However for me the move is incredibly important for bringing to the fore a turning point in the modern human civilization. Ability of humankind to destroy itself without needing any interstellar objects is a haunting prospect and this could be via nuclear weapons or via a more contemporary advances in AI.. The youth and future generations would be well served by watching this movie and being awakened to the destructive possibilities. In 1945, there was arguably a greater horror in the form of Hitler and fascists. Today there are horrors and evil forces but none that pervasive and so we are better served to unite in the thinking and philosophy towards the development and use of weapons of mass destruction.. Before I close off, I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy since Peaky Blinders and there is no better person to have essayed this fascinating character and genius. Watch the movie and make a note to watch it again to learn more .."

10/10,History never ceases to amaze me,08 2023,"History is uncomfortable, it's painful but the truth must be spoken one way or the other. The public is very well aware of the consequences of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima but what went behind the doors, the bureaucracy and the challenges it faced was unclear until I saw this movie. I'm not saying everything in the film was factually correct but it painted an important lesson that the atomic bomb is not something to play with. The audience is too busy criticizing the naked body of Florence or the cinematic performances of the film, they are missing out on the actual point the film is trying to deliver which is that the scientists did not live their lives celebrating the death of thousands but rather spent their lives trying to correct the wrongs, trying to keep the dangerous weapon from being played on the field ever again. The line ""They wont fear it until they understand it. They wont understand it until they've used it"" - sums up the entire film and the logic behind the decision. Oppenheimer was a genius but also a complicated man but how could you not be when you possess such intelligence - the film also did a fantastic job on illustrating this."

6/10,Fall of Nolan,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,"Beautiful, relentless, inspiring",08 2023,"Great movie, intriguing story and themes, beautifully shot, packed with fantastic actors. The pace is superb, relentless not unlike that of The Dark Knight, yet through three hours of biography, science and politics. Never boring, always suspenseful. Cillian Murphy is exceptional and gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Robert Downey is surprisingly strong and subtle. The musical score was effective, beautiful and interesting, Göransson outdid his work for Tenet. I recall how Jurassic Park partially inspired me to study mathematics, and I wonder how many this movie will inspire to major in theoretical physics, I think it will be quite a few."
8/10,Could have been perfection,07 2023,This is more or less a feature documentary type of a movie made only for people who have the basic knowledge of Oppenheimer and the first atomic bomb.
8/10,Cillian Murphy exceptional in the lead role,08 2023,This is a superbly made film as one would expect in the hands of Director Christopher Nolan. Cillian Murphy gives an Oscar worthy and completely convincing performance as Oppenheimer and there are strong performances too from the supporting cast - Robert Downey junior and Matt Damon in particular. The films great strengths are firstly how it recreates the wonder and thrill of the underlying science and secondly how it paints such a vivid portrait of the title character. On the negative side it doesn't really appropriately convey the sheer horror of the use of nuclear weapons. It's a long film and personally I'd have liked more of its time to have been used up in that regard but overall it's an accomplished piece of work.
8/10,"and the audience was educated, but Nolan didn't do his due dilligence",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,A Masterful Display of Acting Brilliance and Audio-Visual Spectacle,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring cinematic masterpiece that leaves a profound impact on its audience. Led by the remarkable performances of Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Emily Blunt, and a talented ensemble cast, this film weaves an enthralling narrative that delves deep into the complex lives of its characters. Helmed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, ""Oppenheimer"" delivers a visually stunning experience that combines breathtaking visuals with powerful audio direction, making it a film that truly resonates with its viewers."
10/10,"A Grand Opus With ""JFK"" Vibes. The Dark Knight Reins Supreme, But This Might Just Be Nolan's Absolute Best Work.",08 2023,"Those complaining about this film not passing the Bechdel Test and being too boring, would make the same complaints about the classic 12 Angry Men. Those complaining about the nudity in this film have completely missed the point. The film shows Oppenheimer as a slightly awkward person who used his intelligence as his charm with women. The first sex scene was as expected, slightly awkward almost like the first time you lose your virginity. In the book, Oppenheimer, experienced abusive pressure from his mother in who he should date. The first sex scene is them barley nude with her in-control and dominating him. The later is them both equally comfortable and fully exposed to their core with each other. Like the bomb he's building...they're drawn together, attracted to each other, and when connected sensational things happen, but they're destructive to each other and to those around them. The fact we're still talking about it, proves it was a psychologically effective visual of seeing Oppenheimer and his mistress both on top of each other in that hearing room with Emily Blunt staring directly into her eyes. It's about exposure, to their core, and then to the world."
6/10,Star-studded Cast Brings Dialog Heavy Biopic,07 2023,"A star-studded cast brings a very interesting although dialog heavy presentation of the trials of J Oppenheimef and his role in creating the automic bomb. The cast delivers stellar performances but the movie drags on partly because it is so thick in content and dialog, but also because as usual with a Nolan film, will likely require a second viewing to get all the nuances. Both it's strength and it's weakness, is the subject matter about the controversies surrounding the atomic boom: it will seem like an old rehash by many viewers, and like a fresh look to others. In either case, the acting and writing presents excellent and fresh content about the life and trials of Oppenheimer."

6/10,"Highly overrated but good acting, too slow for me.",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
5/10,"Boring, Hour too long",08 2023,"What to say about Oppenheiemer? Its long, and kinda boring. Lets start with downs of the movie. As always, Nolan does his thing with non-linear story telling. If he told us which year it is at what point, maybe you would feel more involved into it. This way we have no way of telling other than haircuts and real life events whera are we exactly. This way we dont know are they racing against the clock to make the bomb or do they have time to party like its 1999? Although performances are really good (Robert Downey JR. And Murphy), but that part of the movie is really not that interesting. I expected more from the bomb to be honest. They hyped it in promo but its not that eciting when you see it on big screen."
9/10,This movie is not about quantum science,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,A Masterpiece of Effortless Acting,07 2023,"In the realm of cinematic brilliance, few films can boast a roster as astounding as Oppenheimer. Directed by the visionary Nolan, this movie is an absolute treat for cinephiles, but not for casual viewer. But what sets this film apart from the rest is the awe-inspiring performances by a multitude of S-class actors, who deliver their roles with such astonishing realism that it's hard to believe they are merely ""acting."""
10/10,"Its not a Bomb, its an Explosion!",07 2023,I don't know how to put it into words but Nolan just delivered a MONUMENTAL MASTERPIECE.

10/10,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""",07 2023,"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!"
6/10,"Great movie up to event, then drawn out, boring",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
3/10,Slow and lacking creativity,08 2023,"I think people are confusing ""a good story"" with a good movie. If you want the story, go to a library and read about the real life events. No matter what moment you skip to in this movie, it's a bunch of guys in suits sitting around a table. There are a few scenes that have small exposure to something other than men in suits in an office or sitting in a meeting, but it was over hype on the actual production quality, lacking a variety in set design and story inclusion beyond repetitive generic settings. The acting is decent, it just felt like a lot was missing to capture the full spectrum of emercing the audience in the time period of the movie and other aspects that could have been filmed to create a more comprehensive image. I could have enjoyed this movie as much by simply reading the script."

10/10,Bio-Epic,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan has already made a case for why he is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time with films like Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk and Prestige.

I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all."

10/10,Oppenheimer is a cinematic experience you'll remember forever...,07 2023,"Just seen this movie today and i was completely lost in the world of this movie, 3 hrs passed just like the blink of eyes... This movie is a biography of J Robert Oppenheimer which tells us about how he became the father of atomic bomb and changed the world forever.. Cillian Murphy nailed the titular role without any doubt he is the finest actors of our generation you can see the emotions he shows on screen just by his face and that's how i can say that Christopher Nolan nailed the casting of this movie.. RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh all are perfectly cast in their roles of these real life persons who changed the course of our history.. RDJ is not just some comedic actor who played Iron Man in MCU but he is also one of the finest actors ever and you can feel this just by seeing his performance in this movie...Tom Conti also shines as legendry Albert Einstein in this movie even though his role of small... Christopher Nolan is able to deliver a masterpiece again in name of this movie which will be remembered for a very long time in future, without any doubt Oppenheimer will become a Classic in future since it's on of the greatest movies ever made... Screenplay, Music, Cinematography, Pacing everything is just perfect.. If you know just even basic Science like Nuclear fission and fusion, division of atoms, electrons, hydrogen etc you'll love thus movie even more since you can easily understand what is shown on screen.. It just didn't acts as a political movie about World War, Communism but also as a basic human story about Morals, Humanity, God like power to mankind etc.."
7/10,The good for the greater bad,07 2023,"I took a couple of days to digest three hours of slow burn drama so here we are, ready to blast an impossibly objective review. Let's begin with the obvious: this is 100% Nolaned; the script is clean and meticulous; Robert Downey Jr stands out for best acting followed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt; Matt Demon isn't credible; the music is too insidious; the visuals and the story itself aren't worthy of a big screen. Now that the most evident is dissected, here is the trick. The movie portraits an American patriot that oscillates between pride and guilt with enough elements to pull in both directions simultaneously. And when you think the script was a straight line without twists (and you would be right), subplots emerge to at least complete three hours of dialogues with emoted tension and resolution in the life of a scientist, the father of the atomic bomb, turned both monster and hero. My biggest turn off is that he story and the film deserve two hours - not three."
9/10,Cinematic masterpiece......It Might puncture the Academy Jury's Minds once again!!,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan, known for his technical brilliance, delves into the biographical genre for the first time with ""Oppenheimer."" putting a unique spin on the portrayal of the legendary figure. One notable aspect of Nolan's directorial style is his ability to focus on characters and their emotions. Similarly, he successfully attempts to depict the complex character of Oppenheimer, who, in reality, had two distinct sides."
6/10,CSPAN has more exciting Senate Confirmation Hearings,07 2023,"This movie has too much going on and not enough at the same time. The focus seems to be communism and a senate confirmation hearing rather than the reasoning and human impact of the bomb. The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close."
8/10,Better than Tenet!,07 2023,"After having a fun time at Hoyts Cinemas with my Dad here's my spoiler-free review of Oppenheimer! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my favourite moments of watching this movie & my conclusion/rating! Christopher Nolan is back with his latest instalment after the mixed reviews of Tenet and you know what? It's better than that! Cillian Murphy looks older than he does in the director's previous films he's starred in! The rest of the cast is great too, Robert Downey Jr. Is such a talented actor since he is Iron Man and I've only seen the first Sherlock Holmes movie but I'll watch A Game of Shadows before the third one arrives (If it comes out). Along with brilliant performances by Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt (who used an American accent which was weird cuz she's British IRL), Oscar winners; Rami Malek & Gary Oldman (who I didn't recognize while watching it). It was 3 hours long, I was careful not to drink too much water (just like Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One), I fell asleep in bits of it and I stayed awake for the rest of it which was funny! Overall this is not only better than Christopher Nolan's last blockbuster but also Barbie which I won't watch! That's why I'm giving this an 8/10! I look forward to watching movies at home while I wait for Kraven The Hunter to release in October! ;-)"
8/10,Not worth the effort.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Complex and Thought-Provoking,07 2023,"Barbenheimer is deemed this year's biggest cinematic event, and the two distinct films have both exceeded my personal expectations. More than I hoped for- Oppenheimer is a gripping, intense psychological drama. While not for the faint of heart and sometimes hard to watch, it is sure a film that is to change our modern cinematic Hollywood landscape. Oppenheimer's striking, unique filmmaking techniques, effects, and cinematography leaves viewers in awe or shock while truthfully aiding in the storytelling. Although the storytelling and structure is non-linear, I found it not too difficult to follow along to and carefully and cleverly crafted. The sound design of the film is phenomenal and sometimes unexpected (in a remarkably sensational way that shifts perspectives of events). Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack was absolutely essentially to the dramatization of the story and events. The stellar screenplay and performances truly shined through Nolan's insane direction of the film. Although the first act felt a bit slow at times, I was blown away by the film at the end and was left wanting more, hoping it would not end. Oppenheimer revealed more depth than I imagined by exploring the leading character's moral dilemmas and the effects of the political landscape at the time. While not necessarily for all ages or types of audiences, Oppenheimer is fresh, absorbing, notable, and must be seen in the theaters on the big screen."
9/10,"Another Christopher Nolan gem, but something feels a bit off with the pacing & portrayal",07 2023,Some of the things I think are good about this movie:
6/10,different one from Nolan,08 2023,Unusual biographical drama from the genius director.
9/10,"The must-see movie of the year, if not decade",07 2023,"The movie is long at the 3 hours, but it doesn't seem that way. Cillian Murphy looks very much like Oppenheimer in this. Did you know that he ate only one almond and water for weeks to lose the weight? I worry about actors who do stuff like that - many doctors think it is dangerous. His performance is excellent, I am sure that an Oscar nomination will be forthcoming. But the highlight for me in acting was Robert Downey, Jr. As Lewis Strauss, the former head of the Atomic Energy Commision who developed a deep hatred for Oppenheimer on a perceived slight at a hearing. And he was suspicious of Oppenheimer communist ties - he teamed up with Edward Teller, who was angry with Oppenheimer because of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb to wreck Oppenheimer's professional life. At least so far this year, I think Downey is a shoo-in for a best supporting actor Oscar. The movie is filled with many other fine actors, including Rami Malek (""Mr. Robot"") who has a relatively small but key role in the hearings on Strauss. Emily Blunt is very good as Oppenheimer's wife but the highlight from the female acting performance for me is Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. My only casting complaint is Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves; Groves was a beefy, gruff man, I don't think Damon fills that bill - the late, great Brian Dennehy would have been perfect. Surely there is a similar actor out there. The movie is filled with half of Hollywood it seems, including Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, and Josh Hartnett. It is the must-see movie of the year or even the decade!"
9/10,"""Exciting, full of paradox, haunting.""",08 2023,"First, I want to record some lines from the movie that highlight the movie in my mind."
9/10,An exceptional film in all respects,08 2023,"'Oppenheimer' sounds like it could be boring - a film about a theoretical physicist in the early 20th century. This could not be further from reality - I'd have to rate this up there with Nolan's best work, almost better than 'Inception' and 'The Prestige'. Time will tell. Cillian Murphy is excellent as Robert Oppenheimer, who leads America's ""Manhattan Project"" during 1942-1945 in the race to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis and end World War II."
9/10,Brilliant,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the intriguing story behind the creation of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project. With a stellar cast led by the remarkable Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, supported by the charismatic Robert Downey Jr. And the talented Emily Blunt, the film takes audiences on an emotional and intellectual rollercoaster."
10/10,A challenging and rewarding epic masterpiece,08 2023,"The conflicted story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project and his development of a potent atomic weapon that could end the course of World War II is told on such an epic manner as it should be told and wasn't before. It's a story that needed to be told and it was done in a most captivating and gripping manner that a film of this magnitude will take a long time to come. Like an atomic bomb, it was a shattering and memorable event that it'll change the world of cinema for ages to come."
9/10,Best of the year,08 2023,"Rewatching without some preconceived notions, knowing what is to come and not missing the first two minutes like the first time made this so much better for me this time, even though the theatre was a bit of a downgrade from the first time. The first time, I was a couple of minutes late, and even after reaching, settling and relaxing made the first scene that register in my mind, the apple scene which kind of completely shifted my perception and made me judge the movie differently. This time the proper opening really changed that. I knew how technically brilliant this was from the first watch but this time the emotional rapport was also perfect for me. Oppenheimer is the kind of flawed hero Nolan loves to portray. My qualms about what was chosen to show and what wasn't made much more sense this time. It was also great to see a biopic that didn't combine a lot of characters into one but instead used a plethora of great actors perfectly cast to each role, which can only be done by a director like Nolan because of his unique ""star-power"" as a director."
10/10,CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE,07 2023,"""Now I am becoming death, the destroyer of worlds"""
7/10,Mixed Bag,07 2023,"OH man, I know I'm going to get thumbs down but I kept checking my watch after the 2 hour, this film really was an auditory assault of tediousness, I think this is an example of a movie that is soooo overhyped, while it was a very good movie, acting great, visuals spectacular, I definitely recommend reading up on who's who, as Nolan goes right into it without giving much of an explanation I think probably about 30 minutes could have been trimmed and it would be fine, also I was lost as these characters breeze right through the dialogue with a LOUD soundtrack playing over them a la Aaron Sorkin (first scene of Social Network) Lastly, also be aware that the black and white scenes are the future while the color scenes are the past."
9/10,Simply Outstanding,07 2023,"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that's precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan's three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist's life, chronicles his development of ""the gadget"" and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer's odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture's production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering's outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder."
7/10,"It has it's moments, but it's a bit slow",07 2023,"Big Nolan fan here, but I was overall disappointed in the film, I think I had too higher expectations going into it. The film had some absolutely amazing moments in these short spans which I loved to bits...and then would revert to a slow movie where the pacing wasn't great. The film felt like it dragged a little to fill up the 3 hour runtime."
5/10,Movie is playing while I'm writing this...,07 2023,"The result is important, but that's about it and e all already know that. The story is boring and the movie is the most pretentious thing I have seen in a long time. I get it, the result is a big deal, probably the biggest deal known to human kind. But the movie isn't telling me anything I don't already know nor is it making it seem interesting but oh boy it sure is trying. It's sad cause Cillian has been one of my favorite actors. But the movie seems like a whole movie saying ""this is important and we are important people telling you how important this is"". We get it. Was looking forward to this WAY more than Barbie, but honestly Barbie wins. Im fighting hard to stay awake for the second half.....GOD THE SECOND HALF! I have to go back in now, let's see if I can do it."
9/10,I can only describe it as cinematic excellence.,08 2023,"However, I will have trouble rating this. I will admit that the initial premise didn't have me sold. A three hour film about scientists creating the nuclear bomb and the following court case seemed kind of like a slog. But the trailers and the first reviews were good."
9/10,I certainly hope this film will be a wake-up call,07 2023,"I read the book on which the movie was based, and this film is exactly as I imagined it, and it was almost perfect yet as good as it will ever get."
9/10,Epic and brilliantly crafted.,07 2023,"9/10. Christopher Nolan proves once again that he is one of the most prolific filmmakers of our time. This biographical drama is brilliantly crafted, epic in scope, and has powerful storytelling anchored with a very well-rounded cast. The way he crafts this film on a terrifying subject is beautiful and intense."
9/10,A truly haunting tale of the American Prometheus,07 2023,"Oppenheimer, a breathtaking three-hour marvel, undoubtedly represents Christopher Nolan's magnum opus as a director. Throughout the film, the audience is seamlessly drawn into the protagonist's journey, becoming emotionally invested in every decision he makes. Divided into three major set pieces, the narrative gracefully unfolds, chronicling his ascent, the arduous path to achieving the unimaginable and earning the mantle of an American hero, and finally, confronting the impact of his legacy as history smirks on."
9/10,An achievement in filmmaking.,07 2023,Oppenheimer.
6/10,"Openheimer, the sushi of cinema",08 2023,"We are in an era where the movies are good as the popularity achivied. Not a bad movie but I find it too long and with out personality; nothing that we didn't saw before. It's just like a big commercial product with the clear intention to please everyone. What was the objetive of the plot? Introducing us in the political issues? In the way of think of the protagonist? It was a love story? It was a scientific movie? Try every thing and didn't achieve at all. Not only tries so hard to please everyone but also to not offend any. Even the US that is so the thing to critize nowadays, and i mean these dumb excuses about the nuclear boms. The message is extremely simple, like ""I'm 14 and that's deep"". Looks much like a mix between Netflix soulless production and the Disney moral agenda. I have the feeling that people said they love it to sound profound. Like sushi, gives some sort of status but doesn't tastes as good as a hamburguer."
8/10,Oppenheimer,07 2023,"Traces the story of Robert Oppenheimer from so-so college student through to his fascination with quantum mechanics and the setting up of The Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb. This is all against a womanising background, his somewhat dangerous dabblings with politics and the American government's obsession with communism and the determination to pin that on Oppenheimer and relieve him of all authority after the war."
7/10,"Good movie, excellent actors, but for a 'Nolan' bit disappointing.",08 2023,"Thanks for this movie , i enjoyed it, no doubt about that. But it was different than expected. Had in mind a more 'Dunkirk/Tenet´ type of movie. Missed the technology race against the nazies, the spies, the build-up to acutally dropping the bomb, the B29 Enola Gay story, the USS Indianapolis story, duck & cover, etc. So many stories behind this important part of history. Instead, lots of politics in a tiny board room and some kind of courthearings. But i should have guessed it from the movies title; it's all about the guy not about the bomb story. But as said, enjoyed it, but more 'Netflix' than a Nolan 'Blockbuster'."
5/10,Oppenheimer is not a very enjoyable movie to watch,08 2023,"I will start this review by stating that I have yet to compare the movie to the ""true story"" of Oppenheimer. I think that is a good thing as I do not want my review to be based solely on whether or not the movie is historically accurate, but whether or not I enjoyed the movie overall."
9/10,"A definite contender for Oscar recognition. Nolan, Murphy and Downey Jr. nail it!",08 2023,"The true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist who during World War II was appointed by Gen. Leslie Groves to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer spent years developing the atomic bomb, with his team of scientists. Their work led ultimately to success after they finally witness the first nuclear explosion in world history. However, when it is ultimately used against the Japanese, which brings about the end of the war. Oppenheimer is forced to face the current and future moral implications that would lead to the arms race."
8/10,"Such an expensive movie, and then you fail to speak proper Dutch for one minute",07 2023,"In the movie, Oppenheimer is a professor in Leiden, The Netherlands. You can hear him speak 'Dutch' for a class of students, but everyone in our Dutch movie theatre mumbled 'what? What's he saying?' It was a fantasy language, and certainly not Dutch, not even German. I think making a movie about real events requires proper investigation and love for details. Therefore we thought it was irritating that the actor and director didn't check this scene with Dutchies. The movie was very long and there were lots of characters and names you had to remember, but the general warning and impact of human destruction power and balances of power was very clear and very frightening. The uncertainty whether the bomb would destroy the complete atmosphere, and that they took that risk: man, one day we will really destroy earth, one way or the other."
9/10,Near-perfect biopic that demands your attention,07 2023,Let's be honest here. This isn't your average World War II film; filled with violent war scenes and American nationalistic themes.
7/10,Watched the entire movie holding my breath but had some reservations in regards to the montage,08 2023,"Except for some forgivable goofs, the entire story is a masterpiece. It demonstrates how a talented and complex man achieved both, great success in managing a team of brilliant physicists to perform one of the hardest tasks possible in an extremely short time and in propagating the ideas that would restrict the use of the invention he managed to bring to life."
9/10,Humanity is amazing and terrifying,07 2023,"Oppenheimer was one of the most disturbingly deep and real movies I have ever seen. It took a dive into imagination and growth, social and political turmoil, the unstoppable human struggle for achievement, ethics of power, and the terrible reality of fear and aspiration. I expected a film focused on the bomb itself with Oppenheimer's life as a small support. I'm glad I was wrong. This movie showed the full story. The good, the bad, and the ugly truth of life of Oppenheimer and everyone around him. Everything makes sense now. After decades important things lose their significance and seem to be mundane but I'm genuinely amazed and afraid of what humanity can do now."
6/10,This was definitely a film that I watched,08 2023,"So there has been an undoubted amount of anticipation for this movie so I was very much seated in the cinema, looking forward to watching it, especially as I usually enjoy whatever Christopher Nolan has to offer. At the end of the movie I was neither underwhelmed nor overwhelmed, just merely whelmed."
2/10,Dull. So dull.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Will It Ever End?,07 2023,"The only thing that kept me from giving this film a 9 instead of an 8 is the length. Not much shorter than the actual war. The directing was excellant and the cast is superb. The only one I had a small problem with was the choice for President Truman. I think in real life Truman was gruffer. Other than that, everyone was right on. I believe the story line was fairly accurate as was the locations. I strongly recommend seeing this film, if you can sit for 3 hours. So, pack a lunch, put your feet up and enjoy. I think you will not feel cheated and certainly not happy and upbeat but very informed."
10/10,This was an experience I never want to forget in my life,07 2023,There is not a single thing I didn't like in this film.
10/10,The most beautiful work you have seen in 2023,07 2023,"It is a very great movie in all respects. I watched it on the imax screen. It was something dazzling throughout the 3 hours. I did not feel bored or look at the clock at all. The acting was very beautiful and also, for sure, the directing was very great. The dialogues that were present throughout the film were beautiful and had a strong meaning and presence in the story. It is not present in vain. I expect that I will watch it in the cinema more than once during this period. It is one of the most beautiful works that I have seen during the past two years and deservedly deserves the Oscar in many aspects."
10/10,Long lasting but never boring,09 2023,While the film has a very long run-time I was never bored during it. During the end of the 2nd act I thought the movie was ending soon but it went on for another hour and managed to get me invested again in the B-Plot and its conclusion.
10/10,My experience,07 2023,"As one that loves Nolan's work, i never watched one of his films on cinema."
6/10,I struggled with this film ..,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Not enough Josh Peck.,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a wonderful, immaculate film-a beautifully crafted, powerful story chronicling the human impact of its historical events. It's full of character and tension."
6/10,Overhyped and Weakest movie of Nolan so far but .......,07 2023,"It is the weakest movie of Christopher Nolan but it is still watchable and far better than many movies that came this year and previous years. Thanks to its bgm. Feels like suspense Horror movie, but it's not. Nothing much to say about it's acting. Nothing extra ordinary. Story is Bah. Nothing that you may find exciting. Best thing in entire movie is the bgm. Save your money and watch in ordinary screen, no need of going for IMAX. It's a dialogue heavy and totally a dialogue driven movie. Don't expect great visual as per the current going hype. It's a overhyped movie. Weakest work of Nolan. I think it's the topic or the theme of this movie. What else can you expect. Nolan tried to do his best. Unlike other Nolan movies, It is just, One time watch only, strictly."
3/10,Overhyping is counterproductive as it raises expectations to unrealistic levels that leads to disappointment,08 2023,"Sorry but it just doesn't live up to the pre-game hype! And it's certainly not worth the extra for an IMAX viewing of bland desert landscapes, meetings and chalkboards full of maths symbols!"
10/10,Christopher Nolan gets better and better with every new movie.,07 2023,"There's always 3 sides to a story. In this case it will be, Oppenheimer's, then there is Christopher Nolan's version (based on the biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin) and the truth. We hope and pray that what's shown is as close to the real story; magnified for cinema, but true to the events that happened."
10/10,Oppenheimer - A film that leaves you unsettled,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan is a genius. The pacing, the cinematography and the acting all coming together for quite the spectacle. Oppenheimer much like the man is a complex, layered movie. I found that the non-linear storytelling really worked for me and it helped heighten the moments of tension. I really liked the choice of only showing the Trinity Test and not the actual bombings, and the consequences of developing and dropping those bombs. The last hour of the movie and especially the last few minutes before the credits roll are haunting and will sit with you."
9/10,"Nolan delivers dazzling, dizzying character study of a flawed man who changed the world",07 2023,"Christopher Nolan tackles one of the most divisive scientific achievements in human history--the invention of the atomic bomb--through the lens of it's chief creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the resulting fallout this achievement had on Oppenheimer himself."
9/10,Oppenheimer meets its objectives.,07 2023,"Well, I'm not sure why everyone is criticising the movie when it's actually quite good."
8/10,Oppenheimer: A Grand Yet Intimate Biopic,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a stellar addition to Christopher Nolan's lineup. This movie showcases Nolan's gift for visuals with stunning cinematography that captures the intensity of its historical backdrop. The performances are top-notch, with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Delivering particularly standout performances, enriching the narrative with their depth and complexity."
10/10,Perfect,07 2023,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar."
6/10,Horrible dialogue sound issues,07 2023,"After making a semi pilgrimage to watch this film in one of the handful of IMAX theaters in California, my main takeaway is frustration. Way too much of the dialogue is drowned out by background noise. Struggling to make sense of what characters are saying is not my idea of a good time. The director appears to have fallen in love with this technique. While he and ""critics"" verbally put an artistic spin on it, I truly believe there's nothing more to it than a deep seated power complex. It really knocked the enjoyment down several pegs for me. So much going for this film and yet my lasting takeaway is annoyance."
6/10,Overrated movie,09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
2/10,A Jumbled Historical Mess With A Good Message,09 2023,Christopher Nolan's first historical film. Yeah. Hopefully his last.
10/10,Destroyer of worlds,07 2023,The whole movie I was wondering how it couldn't possibly have any CGI in it.
10/10,The power of cinema,07 2023,"The impact of an image, a sound, a vibration, all together to create emotions."
9/10,POWERFUL! SUBLIME!,07 2023,"Powerful. Sublime. All this adjectives used for this movie are absolutely right. The double plot in this movie works really well, and the cuts between scenes showed us perfectly what time it really was. The cinematography resonates with the weightiness of the subject, weaving a visual tapestry of awe. And, of course, let us not forget the exceptional brilliance of every actor and actress, each breathing life into their characters with sheer marvel. A masterpiece and a future classic for sure."
9/10,Murphy's law of acting,07 2023,I will definitely going to watch it again on IMAX when I get the chance as this is some high quality story telling. The movie is worth the hype created before the release.
9/10,9 out of 10...for now,07 2023,"The reason this is only a 9 is simply because I have only watched it once. I have given 19 films a 10/10, including 3 Nolan films (Inception, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige.) I will probably end up changing this to a 10/10, but want to watch it one more time before I do bc I take a 10/10 rating very serious. Now lets get into the movie:"
10/10,"""Now i have become Death. The destroyer of worlds""",07 2023,"Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN REACHED PERFECTION!"
7/10,"Technically brilliant, but lacking in emotional beats.",09 2023,"Nolan's films are usually a hit or a miss for me. However no one can deny the brilliance of his filmmaking. This film takes its time and then some to tell its story, and I believe it could have benefited from a shorter run time."
10/10,Powerful!,07 2023,"I just watched ""Oppenheimer"" and it is a masterpiece. I am not a huge of fan of history nor biography movies, but this movie made me reconsider all my life choices."
7/10,Nolan needs to reign himself in a bit,08 2023,"I think this film was brilliantly acted, beautifully shot , the script was excellent based on an amazing story which has changed the world for ever. So what's the problem? The degree of non-chronological story telling made it difficult to follow and simultaneously enjoy the film. I understand the reasons for doing this,it's a complicated story but as viewer without the in depth knowledge of the subject it was a difficult watch. I will watch this again, and perhaps i'll enjoy it more having already absorbed some of it. But I did not leave the cinema thinking that was a great film and the final hour while informative it gave me a headache."
10/10,Tense and haunting film,08 2023,"It's crazy how one of the most anticipated summer blockbuster films of this year is based on a historic figure...and it's directed by Christopher Nolan. I think this is the movie people been wanting for a while. Something not action-pack, not computer generated, not fun or silly quips, but something new or refreshing that us audiences haven't seen in a long time. Even with Nolan's style of filmmaking, this movie feels different from the rest of his work. It's basically a 3-hour movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer rises and fall of his fame as becoming the ""father of the atomic bomb."" It's mostly people talking throughout the movie, but the main focus is Oppenheimer which is more of a character study in his point of view and Lewis Strauss. The cast was fantastic, it was visually stunning, the music score is very tense like you were a part of that certain scene, the story was great as usual from Christoper Nolan. Sometimes the sound mixing can be loud between dialogues, but I can easily make it out what characters are saying. In the end, the movie will leave you in fear for what the future of a nuclear weapons will be and the consequences."
8/10,Nolan does it again,07 2023,I went into the movie with high expectations and overall it did deliver well.
9/10,"It's not what I expected, but I really appreciated it.",07 2023,"Even though I'm not all that attached to the story, the way the film portrays the complex emotions of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is fascinating. It gives audiences like us the freedom to interpret the identity of Oppy through the perspectives of him and the people around his life. Even though the film is mainly told from the Destroyer of Worlds's point of view, one can't help but think accordingly: in fact, What kind of person does he see himself as?"
9/10,not my type of film BUT,07 2023,"I was really taken by it. It is 3 hrs long but time flies fast when you watch it. Interesting, complelling and not too hard to follow but yeah you have to concentrate with all the dfferent names on scientists etc... A very strong biopic. Great actors. Gary Oldman, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon and many more. I would say Robert Downey Jr is the big star in this movie, but of course Cilian Murphy is magnetic too. I usually go for more relationship-oriented movies with strong psychological portaits so I was a little bit hesitant about this one. Action, Nolan.... not my cup of tea... I had my prejudies! But it's one cinematic experience and it is worth all the hype, unlike the Barbie movie."
9/10,3 hours of sheer panic,07 2023,"So Oppenheimer is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated movies of the year by many people including myself, a Nolan epic people wait for and it delivers, not without some flaws but the types of flaws don't carry nearly as much weight as the positives."
6/10,Hollywood hype,07 2023,"This is one of those films where the industry was desperate for summer blockbuster so they stuck a big name director on it and then hyped it for 12 months to create an excitement and anticipation....and the film just doesn't warrant or fulfill that. I think the best way to convey the actual film aside from the circus surrounding it would be that had it not been publicised beyond belief and Nolan not been the director nobody would be talking about it! It's overly long, boring, it doesn't give away any real nuances about RJO's personality or build his character well....or give any real insights...... and they managed make the race to make the atomic bomb boring."
8/10,Great but long!!!,07 2023,"Saw this tonight at a premier party in Oak Ridge, TN of all places. Packed house. Sold out in all theatres. Gotta admit I wish I had gone to imax just for a few scenes, but really, most of the movie was really about political drama as opposed to the atomic bomb. I was really impressed with the acting and think Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar. Nolan-maybe. Downey, probably no. I liked him and he did a great job, don't get me wrong, but I'll admit, until I realized the motivations of his character I didn't really understand his significance. Movie could have done a better job at pointing out what the political points were in the second half because I was little lost. I did think that the final third of the movie dragged a little but maybe that's because I was in about my 5th hour at the theatre, with the premier pre activities, and was pretty tired. I will say that, for me, the payoff was, after all the congressional hearings and back room interrogation, the last two minutes. It brought it all together for me. So, while I did love this movie, I can't quite give it past an 8 for some of the aspects that didn't just quite make it the experience I thought it was going to be."
6/10,Its drama movie why turn it to mystery!,08 2023,"The first 2 hours of movie were nothing..just some cuts from here and there,from present anf from past, its a drama movie why Nolan make everything as mystery and playing with time,the role of director to make the audience get the idea in beautiful and easy way,why he make everything complex to follow and understand,the soundtrack was noisy and annoying, thanks God Nolan didnt direct beautiful mind or theory of everything, he also didnt show the bomb attack on Jaban and what the criminal oppenheimer did, also the team of bomb makers were against using it against Jaban,then they celebrating the attack and we didnt see the opposite members emotions."
2/10,Don't let this movie top the box office. Christopher Nolan is unexceptional!!,09 2023,"There's a joke in the Barbie movie where the Barbies distract the Kens by saying they've never seen the Godfather only to have it eagerly explained to them. Oppenheimer has now joined that illustrious list of films. This movie is such a pretentious, and I'm very confused by any means of the movie. The whole movie and the plot, the story, and the music itself is garbage"
8/10,Another ultimate masterpiece,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan has once again created a thought-provoking and visually stunning film with Oppenheimer. Drawing from extensive source material and interviews with those who knew Oppenheimer personally, Nolan crafts a complex and moving portrayal of the scientist tormented by the implications of his scientific discoveries."
10/10,Incredible albeit not perfect and yet still worthy of multiple viewings,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Nolan is always a legend,07 2023,"The best drama ever witnessed, one of the best dramatic experience . Its Nolan's masterpiece, every scene written is a master piece every dialogue, every screenplay has been crafted soo good. Cilian murphy who has just nailed with his performances, he just lived the character of oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is gem in the field of physics and atomic matter. He is soft and introvert which has been portrayed so perfect by murphy, i hope he gets an oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer. All others robert downey, emily , matt and pugh all did their supporting roles to perfect. Especially the strauss role played by our former iron man robert downey jr was world class, hope he gets an oscar too. A special recognition to the music , its the pillar to the movie, soo pure and different and really makes as feel , an ultra realistic experience. Overall an osm drama experience, a complete nolan film with cuts in. Please do watch in theaters."
9/10,Nolan has done everything in Cinema!,07 2023,We always believe Nolan's films are always confusing and mind boggling but the recent Oppenheimer is Nolan's one of the best work.
6/10,Way too long for no reason,08 2023,"I enjoyed this movie for the first half or so, then I realized I was only halfway through the movie. The first thirty minutes or so had some interesting visuals but the directing style seemed to fall flatter as the movie dragged on. I was pretty interested in the process of them figuring out how to make the bomb and the physics of it all, and how that all came together. That was interesting but they included a few other aspects to the movie which weren't very interesting and I eventually got lost in some of that dialogue. It'd be fine to include some about Oppenheimer's personal life and all the politics that occurred but they didn't have to make a whole movie's worth of it. The movie could easily have been two hours instead of three."
6/10,A bit underwhelming...,07 2023,On the + side: Good cinematography Good acting (especially Robert Downey Jr) Interesting story (quite reminiscent of the Alan Turing story)
5/10,Disappointing,08 2023,I registered out of disappointment after seeing this film and disbelief at so many enthusiastic reviews.
9/10,Must Watch - One of the finest biopic ever made,08 2023,"Nolan delivers a compelling biopic which keeps you hooked from the start to finish. Though 3 hours long, it keeps you glued to the screen. This is a movie to be watched n the big screen, nolan weaves a agical experience. The cienematography and story telly is is top nautch. This is one of the finest movie made by nolan."
10/10,"As both history buff and film nerd, this movie is a masterpiece",08 2023,"This movie is a modern cinema masterpiece of and a surprisingly very accurate biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film tracks his life and most impactful/relevant events to his rise as an ambassador of quantum mechanics, great scientist, and his capabilities as a leader and speaker while depicting his inner conflict, his bouts of delusion and arrogance."
10/10,Oppenheimer,09 2023,"Flawless. Oppenheimer is an autobiography film that is significant, complex and gripping, three words seldom associated with an autobiography. Although I cannot tell whether if the real character is as nuanced as the one in the film, the one depicted in the film is such a fantastic character that is so relatable. Oppenheimer touches on so many subjects, and enters the psyches of each character so effortlessly, adding new layers to the film through every dialogue, every frame and every character. At last, the story of the Manhattan Project needed to be told cinematically, and I am ever so glad it is told via Nolan's lenses."
9/10,Oppenheimer (2023),07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Exceptional film about the father of the atomic bomb!,07 2023,This movie was absolutely brilliant. The performance from Cillian Murphy was so genuine as J. Robert Oppenheimer. A perfect performance from him.
8/10,It's a Cristopher Nolan film,07 2023,Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie.
6/10,I was not impressed,08 2023,"From the start of the movie, I had the feeling I could see through the movie and not immerse in the experience as I expected, ...even though I was watching it on IMAX. Unfortunately, this feeling lasted until the end, and only the last scene where he imagined the future war pleasantly surprised me a little. From the explosion sequences in his imagination to the sex scenes, I have felt that all was engineered to trick the spectator that he watches a deep and immersive story which ultimately it wasn't at all, they were just tricks. The originality was that the tricks in this case were not CGI. The movie obviously had an epic PR that ensured box office figures despite the rather ordinary impression it makes. It is not bad, just an unimpressive triple A movie that will be forgotten until next year. I did not appreciate much the cast either, maybe I know Robert Downey Jr. Too well, his habits and gestures to have the feeling that his character is authentic, I would rather prefer the likes of Jeremy Irons for that role. Matt Daemon was also a stretch while for Cillian Murphy definitely was not the role of his career. One other thing about the movie was that I felt that it tried to bend history to fit current times with an ultra-liberal if not communist to be Hollywood. Overall, it was watchable, unlike 99% of Netflix productions, but not really a great movie."
8/10,I Got Bombs But I'm Not a Bomber,09 2023,Oppenheimer posed a tricky question for perennial hit maker Christopher Nolan. How do you make a three hour biopic of a scientist compelling enough to bring in big money? Turns out the answer is to not make a biopic at all.
8/10,Held my attention....,07 2023,"Not going to jump on the band wagon, and say that this film was exceptional, brilliant etc... . But I will say that it was interesting to see what went into building the atomic bomb seeing it from a different perspective... (as they have been many movies about the Manhattan Project). The actors, the script, the pace was great; however, the only negative I have for this movie is it could have done without the sex scenes. I am not a prude in any way, but these scenes were totally useless, and had no real bearing on the story telling.... In all honesty, it really seemed like just gratuitous sex to just tick a box for an r-rated movie. But it truly could have done without them. Other than that I thought it was a really good movie."
10/10,"""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique perspective on the human experience.""",09 2023,"Nolan's bio-pic, based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's Pulitzer-winning biography ""American Prometheus,"" follows the life of physicist and scientist Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer, a student in the 19th century, tours European science capitals before returning to the US and joining Caltech and Berkeley. At Berkeley, he becomes a union organizer and donates to the anti-Fascist cause during the Spanish Civil War. He hangs out with Communist Party members, including his brother Frank and Jackie's wife. Despite not being a Party member, Oppenheimer is spied on by the F. B. I. And meets a Communist medical student named Jean Tatlock, leading to an ill-fated relationship. In 1942, General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) appoints Oppenheimer to oversee the Army's nuclear bomb development program. Despite political suspicion, Groves supports Oppenheimer, who proves to be a master of both scientific and political aspects. However, the Red Scare and his proximity to Communists make him an easy target. Oppenheimer was stripped of his security clearance in 1954. The movie is structured as a mosaic, intercutting Oppenheimer's life from his rise to fall, connecting his early leftism and later pacifism with the McCarthy era. This fractured chronology makes the film less complex, as events are reduced to their function within a larger morality tale. Nolan's film cuts scenes together like a jigsaw puzzle, leaving out contradictions, subtleties, and random peculiarities, leaving a feeling of experience for both the protagonist and the viewer. The movie is a puzzle to be solved rather than lived. ""Oppenheimer"" explores the tension between physics and war, focusing on the character of Jewish and leftist researcher Oppenheimer. He is committed to creating an atomic bomb, believing Nazi Germany is ahead in developing one. However, after Germany surrenders in May 1945, work on the bomb accelerates, causing a moral crisis for Oppenheimer. This mission drift determines the rest of the film and his life. Oppenheimer's involvement in the Manhattan Project leaves him compromised, committed to creating a weapon of unparalleled destructiveness without any control over its use. The film ultimately explores the consequences of his actions during the war. ""Oppenheimer"" is a fascinating film that explores the complexities of individual and collective personality. Despite criticisms of its length, its fascinating physical experience is largely due to its exploration of themes such as Oppenheimer's sex life and Strauss's enmity. The film's focus on governmental hearings, including the third hour, is a testament to its entropic tendencies. The characters appear before a tribunal, bringing to account their contradictions, hypocrisies, and sins. The tribunal is hidden, allowing the audience to make their own decisions, a feature that is as expected of a film. Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique perspective on the human experience. A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws."
10/10,This film will inspire generations film makers.,07 2023,"I'm over the moon with this film. From the visuals to the dialogue and the score. It is simply a masterpiece. Robert Downey, Jr. And Cillian Murphy both Deserves an Academy award. Cillian holds this film on his shoulders in a way I have never seen before. For 3 hours I was transported back to WW2 and the beginning of the military industrial complex."
10/10,Nolan's chef-d'oeuvre!,08 2023,"Just when you think it can't get better than The Dark Knight or Inception, Nolan comes out with his Magnum Opus. The mind and skill required to craft this puzzle is truly extraordinary, and Nolan has cemented himself as one of the greats of all time with this movie."
8/10,1570 IMAX a must!,07 2023,"I have now seen this movie twice, once in regular cinema and once in 1570 IMAX. Even though it was an outstanding movie in regular cinema, I highly encourage you to see it in 1570 IMAX. It wasn't just a completely different experience, it was eye opening how films can be shot and watched."
7/10,Great but would I watch it again???,08 2023,"So, finally after all the hype and all the reviews (Positive and negative), I saw Oppenheimer today at the Leicester Square Cineworld IMAX."
10/10,Magnificent Film,09 2023,Another Nolans Masterpiece.
6/10,Great story poorly told.,07 2023,"This film told the incredible story of how some of the worlds most brilliant minds achieved one of histories most momentous tasks. It contained some excellent acting performances and the dialogue was well written. However, there were parts of the story that were overly long and laboured with some of the special effect interventions either unnecessary or too long & dramatic. The single most dissipate annoying feature of the film (a common issue today in film and TV) was the sound. There were barely 10 seconds of silence in the whole 3 hours. The dial was overlayed with 'music' or sounds for almost the whole film, even when just two characters were conversing. There were sections of dialogue in the film which I will never know as they were impossible to discern being drowned out by the accompanying sound. Disappointing."
10/10,Nolan don't miss,07 2023,"Movie was released on the 19th in my country. In my opinion, it is the most important film Nolan has ever made. I had goosebumps during THAT part in the middle of the movie and at the end. No viewing experience could have given me that suffocating and colossal feeling than in the cinema. The music score, the cinematography, the acting, everything about it is sublime. I sank in my seat and for a good 5 minutes after it ended, none of the people I watched it with made a move. We just kind of sat there in silence, at a loss for words. See this on the big screens. It's an incredible, haunting piece of art and cinema at its finest."
8/10,Solid 8 but not for everyone to understand,07 2023,"This movie is like solid 8 but really not easy to understand. There are several layers like politics, moral, family, history, science and if you want to get the full experience you might need to be like 60-70 years old professor from US who has vivid interest in politics and is really open-minded. Seriously, I was prepared although not falling into this category but most of the audience I think did not understand a lot as they were too young and politically fragile. And that is not even touching the morals of the story or ancient history mentioned briefly. Or consequences for the Japanese that were so terrible. Go there, watch and come back to this movie in 10-15 years again if you are under 45."
8/10,"Expertly made, fully engrossing biopic of gargantuan proportions",08 2023,"""I am become death, destroyer of worlds."""
9/10,The Destroyer of Worlds,07 2023,"For a 3hr long film this movie doesn't drag at all. Oppenheimer flies by and the story is told very rapidly, building the tension so well while building towards the Trinity test. At first I didn't know how I felt about the speed but after watching the film in full I completely understand why Christopher Nolan made that choice. The performances are astonishing across the table with the standouts being Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, and Emily Blunt. They are surrounded by a top tier supporting cast (some with only one or two scenes). Everyone knocks it out of the park and showed up knowing what they were expected to do."
10/10,"For nerds this is like MCU's Avengers, except there are no super-heroes but the scientists. And obviously it's by Christopher Nolan.",07 2023,"His deep blue eyes lay buried in those sockets as he watched the clouds of death and destruction from a distance. His lips quivered but his face showed no emotion. It's like he's frozen in time. Reading this & then imagining how Cillian portrayed it, you'll realise that you've experienced some rare acting skills."
10/10,fantastic cast,07 2023,"The movie is awesomI advise anyone to see a movie whose story is universal and sweet. Cillian Murphy excelled in the character of Robert Oppenheimer And I will go to watch it on the 21st in Iraqi cinemas. The movie is awesome and very strong. I recommend it. The strength of the movie gives you an experience of art and hardshipI don't know why this legendary work is being compared to the failed Barbie movie Opheimer will win an Oscar, an integrated film in all respects, a historical and biographical film I advise you to watch it in IMAX cinemas Don't forget to add me on Instagram, my name a.dq4."

10/10,Three Hours but worth the time,09 2023,"The first half hour or so of the movie was quite disorienting. I kept thinking that I was watching an MTV version of the film. I resigned myself to letting Chris Nolan be Chris. Cillian Murphy encompasses the weird manner that Oppenheimer put out there. And Emily Blunt is powerful as Kitty Oppenheimer. But the movie's fulcrum starts to shift to Robert Downey Jr's performance is Lewis Strauss, whose relationship with Oppenheimer changes the course of our collective history in a way that translates into the original cancel culture of the 50s where anyone who didn't toe the line was treated as a traitor."

9/10,Terrific biopic. Nolan at his peak.,09 2023,"Never imagined I could ever watch a movie with all these qualities. Christopher Nolan directs his first biopic with all the peculiar things which are typical of him and faces Robert Oppenheimer's story and the invention of its atomic bomb with incredible mastery by inserting tension, fear and anguish. Everything accompanied by the excellent and creepy work of ALL the actors who were in the movie (especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.), the cinematography by the immense Hoyte van Hoytema and the vibrant and fabulous music by Ludwig Goransson, to whom I wish he gets nominated and win an Oscar for the masterwork he created."
9/10,Staggering Film,08 2023,Last Summer they said that Tom Cruise had saved Hollywood with Top Gun: Maverick. If that's the case then Christopher Nolan has surely saved the theatrical release of epic serious films with Oppenheimer though also with many of his earlier films.
7/10,Leading a marathon just to fall in the final mile.,07 2023,Another Nolan film which never reaches its full potential.

7/10,It's a mixed bag from Nolan...,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
4/10,Tedious,08 2023,I had a lot of expectations going in to the theater. Perhaps I would learn something about quantum physics. Or I would get to watch and understand the internal struggles of the scientist who created the first weapon of mass desctruction. I didn't get either.
9/10,"The brilliance of human Art, shows a true true evil of men.",07 2023,"The film lays out a journey of humanity's character that which we've never recovered. Powerful evils are perpetrated by such noble ""idealism"" from either side & the ""good"" versus evil debates remain only for the winners to portray the virtues of their side. It's a sickening gut wrenching film of such unimaginable horrors behinds it's subject matter of 2 dropped bombs never explained nor given detail. Only by the films very existence will humanity have yet another example of humankind's ""art"" ego telling war horror for entertainment, no idealism, no whimsical warnings, instead this seems instead a truth. Our very worst imaginings are only outdone by those with the power & ego to forgo their soul to achieve anything for nothing but horror. :Macbeth Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow...."
10/10,"Brilliantly acted, filmed, written, edited, and delivered.",07 2023,"I was very slightly cautious about this movie after Dunkirk disappointed, but Nolan once again proves that film an outlier in his quest to deliver masterpiece after masterpiece of cinema."
8/10,It Took a Few Days to Realize How Extraordinary It is..,07 2023,"My mind was immediately blanked after the three-hour movie was done, but it wasn't confusion or any negative feelings that overwhelmed me. It was the ending scene that hit me hard, a simple yet profound conversation between two scientific greats, Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Hours after the movie's conclusion, scenes flashed in my mind, and I tried to piece them together, yet I found myself grappling with an unanswered question: ""What exactly do I feel?"" The movie had left me with an indescribable sense of wonder. The following day, my thoughts remained fixated on the movie, prompting me to focus on myself instead of researching it further. In this introspection, I realized that ""Oppenheimer"" stands apart from any other movie I have experienced. It isn't driven by piquant conversations about morality or philosophy like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Network."" Instead, it allows you to immerse yourself in the sentiments of a REAL HUMAN, whose mind is brimming with complications and contradictions. The movie's ending scene, which at first seemed simple, had become a profound catalyst for my reflections on the world."
8/10,Moral Relativism,07 2023,"The movie talks about the moral dilemma of making an atomic bomb, and that helps Oppenheimer, who is obsessed with quantum physics, learn about the atomic field by making an atomic bomb, but what makes him make the bomb is more than his scientific interests; it's about his ideological politics. The movie makes me think more about Oppenheimer as a politician than a scientist at the end of the movie."
7/10,"""Men are Talking-The Movie""",07 2023,"And that's pretty much it. Thought I'd be going in to a visual feast conceptualizing quantum mechanics, much like Interstellar did for physics; but was only rewarded with one profound line about how most of the space we occupy is empty, but the matter that creates us also convinces us that there are barriers within that space, or something. So brief and unexplored."
10/10,A Masterpiece,07 2023,"Another masterpiece created by the genius Nolan. Everything in this movie is top notch: The acting performances, the directing, the writing, the editing, the sound, the production, the cinematography, the score, even the make up and costume design."
6/10,"Well acted, well shot, but falls short",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
4/10,Disappointing telling of the most important event in history,07 2023,"Like some of the director's other films, but this was a directorial and editing disaster. I saw the 70mm IMAX version, but the IMAX big-screen features were not used well in this film. It wasn't necessary to see it on a big screen. You would think the bomb scene would make use of the screen, but it was a dud."
9/10,What a movie!,09 2023,"Nolan is definitely my favourite director. And while his latest film has strayed from my favourite genre, sci-fi (Interstellar... just phenomenal), I realized a while back to go with the flow and let Nolan take me on his artistic journey, and I've enjoyed every movie of his immensely. He understands what good art mixed with good storytelling can achieve and I often criticize other movies for their lack of expression and daring because the predictable is the safe path. I mean, this is a biopic! And he manages to inject pure art into it with incredible scenes that help capture the moment."
10/10,Masterpiece infinite goosebumps,07 2023,"The movie is so great , it takes time and you will feel the length of it but when all things come together it becomes one of the best move you'll ever see."

Narrated in flashbacks via two simultaneous hearings, taking us through one man's guilt trip once he understands the politics surrounding him. Though exhausting, the story of the man becoming the destroyer of the worlds is equally exciting."
8/10,"I'm not a history fan, but...",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
6/10,Atomic jump scares,07 2023,"Atomically loud jump scares are littered throughout the film. The film immediately starts with a sudden huge noise then plods quietly through barely discernible dialogue until other sudden huge noises occur regularly to inject adrenalin into the audience. The first hour urgently needs sub titles due to the garbled words. This is strange because the first hour had some scientific theory which, if heard better, would have really added to the film."
5/10,Overrated by a mile,09 2023,"I work as an professional editor so from my point of view it was a terrible long movie but funny enough it still was almost too short to tell the full story.. They should and could easily have made it into a series with 5-6 episodes instead of trying to forcefully edit a crazy amount of dialogues from one scene to another - and with no breaks and pauses between the scenes for most parts. We only get the pause to digest the huge amount of fast pace-dialogues when the bomb is about to blow up.. I suspect that the movie was originally longer, and that they were ordered to trim it down to meet the cinematic requirements.. - Or maybe Nolan just lost his touch? Tenet was a complete disaster and know this? Someone working close to him needs to ""check him"" and tell him to maybe take a step backwards and keep it more simple.. More is not always better."
10/10,phenomenal filmmaking,07 2023,"Drama thriller at its best very best ; editing and cinematography and all technical aspects of the movie is in greatest standards, character arc and screenplay is fascinating ,brilliance written all over it !"
8/10,As Nolan-y as it gets,07 2023,"I'm not especially into biopics - the stories are formulaic by nature, and executing the beginning/ending is never easy (which usually means the middle suffers as a result). ""Genius encounters challenges and overcomes"" can only be so interesting. Enter Christopher Nolan, who uses ALL his tricks to make this film something more than just Oppenheimer's life. And it works. The editing, the time jumps, the sense of chaos, the awe-inspiring cinematography...it all adds stakes over and over. The first two hours just rocketed by. By the time they strapped on their goggles, I was somehow on the edge of my seat for a bomb test with a fairly predictable outcome. The third act dragged a bit, but this was still quite a feat. It's not my favorite Nolan film, but it felt like a maybe the fullest expression of his filmmaking. And I'm glad someone is making movies like this."
7/10,"Long, Laborious Biopic with Loud Music",07 2023,"I always like to consider what directors decide to do when it comes to post production on epics like this. Some directors will choose to use music sparingly, while in some movies, although rare, the director opts to have no music at all. This one not only has music throughout, it is also loud and melodramatic, playing like a Dodge Ram commercial, for three very long hours."
10/10,"""Power stays in the shadows""",08 2023,"As long as this movie was (3hrs) there wasn't a moment wasted. The acting, the script, the cinematography are top notch."
6/10,Nolan fatigue,07 2023,Fantastic performances. Cillian deserves an Oscar. Great cinematography and score. Stellar casting. Gorgeous effects. Very effective portrayal of the frenetic pace of the Manhattan Project and the existential dread that comes along with the invention of these terrible weapons.

Christopher Nolan once again proves his mastery in storytelling and soundtrack, creating a thought-provoking and visually stunning cinematic experience with a beautiful soundtrack. However, it is essential to note that this film might not appeal to everyone and is more suited for a specific audience."
8/10,An Intense and Chilling Experience,07 2023,"Like everyone else I was pretty hyped up for Oppenheimer, the latest flick from Christopher Nolan based on the 2005 biography ''American Prometheus'' by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin. And after watching it, I think it's safe to say it met almost all of my expectations. From a technical perspective, the film is brilliantly well made. The sound design, production design and the breathtaking cinematography are all top notch. On top of that it also has one of the best scores of the year from Ludwig Görranson."

10/10,Nolan does it again,09 2023,"Oppenheimer is a haunting story, a man whose clearly very emotionally conflicted (understandably) despite doing a great service for America and the world. Cillian Murphy brings every feeling to the screen. Nolan has created a masterpiece."
8/10,engages for three hours; a rarity in film making.,07 2023,"Every character well developed and human, not cookie cutter 'cut outs' or stereotyped by race, religion or profession. Attention to detail in every respect IE the images are stunning . Production design , IE sequence of events and the acting and direction could not be better. Oh . . . A script developed by the Film MakeR from . . . A . . . BooK ; in other words good writing. Human drama taken from real life can be more dramatic and interesting than fictional scripts. IMO the film is 1) a stunning achievement and 2) very much worth the three hour length to see it. You won't find yourself saying , 'this movie is too long' as so many are these days. My one warning and criticism is that in some scenes the dialogue is not even intelligible due to so much other sound in the back round. Highly recommended otherwise."
10/10,Oppenheimer has simply blown my mind!,07 2023,"The direction, as expected from Nolan, is nothing short of breathtaking. The way he weaves together past and present, merging personal struggles with scientific achievements, is nothing less than genius. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail in recreating the era is impeccable."

7/10,Strong movie. Not the story I wanted to see.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Christopher Nolans absolute best work,07 2023,I walked out of the cinema in complete awe. The movie had some of the best and most bone chilling cinematography and audio I have ever witnessed. The IMAX experience was out of this world and Christopher Nolan's choice to spend all the time and resources to film in this format was the best decision he possibly could've made. The sound and size of the picture gave it a magnitude like no other. The acting was phenomenal and Cillain Murphy's performance was out of this world. Not a single person in the world that could play the role any better. This movie is a work of art and a definitive Oscar and award winning masterpiece. Easy ten stars.

10/10,The highlight of Nolan's career!,07 2023,"Oppenheimer's fascination with the concept of a black hole or the theory of relativity are Nolan obsessions. He's dabbled in time, relativity and black holes before, just how was he going to make this history lesson so entertaining?"
10/10,This movie made me realize everyone's turned into little kids,07 2023,"Such a good movie, but if you're clearly not interested at all in history, Oppenheimer, the Manhattan project, then obviously this will be boring for you. I do not know what people expected, all these negative reviews feel like little kids upset the teacher showed them a documentary in school or something."
8/10,Amazing work,08 2023,In simple words this movie was epic. Spectacular work of storytelling and execution. Framing was epic too.
7/10,Very good but WAY too loud,08 2023,"I don't understand Nolan's fascination with jacking up the volume of his films to a level that sometimes drowns out the dialogue. It's also not necessary to constantly play background music. I'm not a filmmaker but it's ok to let the dialogue speak for itself. At least with this one I could still hear the dialogue, unlike Insterstellar where much of the film's exposition was drowned out by banging music. I don't recall Nolan's earlier films being this way but I think it may have started around The Dark Knight Rises and definitely hit a crescendo with Interstellar. Anyway, clanging music aside, the film is very good. The acting is superb and the story, minus a couple frankly unnecessary sex scenes, is phenomenal. My favorite scene was the bomb test and the tension of expecting the loud bang that waits for a bit before it actually happens. There's an example where audio was used correctly. It was actually QUIET for what seemed like an eternity and then the loud bang kicked in at just the right time. I wish the music had been handled the same way for the rest of the movie. I also didn't have any problem with the length and while it was preachy at times, the story was still effective and I could see why Nolan has said it's a horror film. Fix the audio and this is a 10."

9/10,A Remarkable Piece Of Filmmaking Provided You Understand What It Is,07 2023,"Usually, the films of Christopher Nolan traffic in mind-bending (often time-bending) science fiction or fantasy. ""Oppenheimer"" is a clear departure from that type of movie, but proves to be just as landmark of an achievement in biopics provided one views it as such."
6/10,No. Behave. it's a complete action less slog.,07 2023,I'm a decent lover of history and knew this would be a slog. It was. Enjoyable for me cos I was into it. But 3 hours of pure torture for anyone who isn't.

10/10,A tour de force!,07 2023,"The intensity with which this film and the actors deliver is nearly off the chart in every scene. From the back-and-forth in time, to the studied nakedness of some characters, to the outright hostility sometimes shown: this is great film-making and great acting. The pace changes, but does not languish. The nuance of self-doubt is played epically by Cillian Murphy, and the suffering Mrs. Oppenheimer is played brilliantly by Emily Blunt. Nearly all the cast are engaging, with hidden sides or fears, faults, and even valor."
10/10,OscarHeimer For 2023!,07 2023,"J. Robert Oppenheimer was an american theoretical-physicist that was the main boss of The Manhattan Project. He worked on the atomic bomb that could stop the wars between 1939 to 1949. This movie was about Oppenheimers story and life, and how the atomic bomb changed the world forever. Oppenheimer was the worlds savior, but also the killer of a thousand people, innocent and not. It was a very well movie, and showed Oppenheimers moral thinking and how he made the bomb. I was really satisfied about this movie. 3 hours was not bad, for what they were going to show, and I wasn't bored any minute. The sound effects in this movie made the atmosphere very good, and the music was perfectly made for what the scene was showing. Great written and directed by Christopher Nolan, that have directed The Dark Knight and Interstellar. The casting was good also, with Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Rami Malek. The moral is very clever and it is also like a warning. That a bomb like that should not be made, and what the consequences can be for making something like that. And Oppenheimers look at the end of the movie, a look of eternity in destruction and madness. That look is something you are going to remember. I did not see it in Imax, like it was filmed in, I have heared that it is very good in it, but if you watch it in normal 2D I guess it is also good and I recommend to watch this movie anyway. Amazing movie, amazing story, acting, and it was very good directed. Should win an Oscar. Definitely."
9/10,"It's an excellent movie, but not Nolan's best",07 2023,"This film is one of those in which you do not realize the time that passes, despite having extensive dialogues, it does not become heavy even for its 3 hours. If you like the history from the perspective of its protagonist and you have slight notions of context, you will like it. You don't need to be an expert in physics or history at all."
10/10,A Staggering Acheivement,08 2023,"Where Tenet failed to rescue post-pandemic cinema, Oppenheimer (along with the very different, eye-wateringly successful, Barbie) may well have succeeded. Christopher Nolan has made a three-hour film, partly in black and white, historical biopic that is mostly men in rooms talking, that grapples with huge moral, ethical and historical issues and turned it into one of the megahits of blockbuster season. In the process, he's rebooted the biopic genre, one of cinema's most creatively moribund genres, an achievement it's hard to imagine any other film-makers taking on."
10/10,Nolan is back with another gem,09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Simple 10/10,07 2023,"I would like to talk about the Oppenheimer movie after I entered the cinema today. Indeed, this movie is really an example of movies that are made for the cinema, not for the home. I would like to stress that this movie is not for all people. Yizenberg and many others, and all the details surrounding the Manhattan Project, whether announced or unknown, surprised me in the film and made me amazed that the film demonized America and its government. Literally, some of its people gather America in this movie. It was a demon. In a scene of Oppenheimer with the president of America after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion, Oppenheimer tells the president, I feel that my hands are stained with blood. 250,000 people were on his neck, he felt about themselves and their suffering throughout his life, and in the end, his country fought him and made him a traitor, and at the end of his life they honored him after he accepted on himself that he was fighting with all those around him in order to only reduce the guilt that he felt. And I will not forget Oppenheimer Einstein's sentence when he said that there was an opportunity in the Manhattan Project that we are destroying the world with our invention. The truth is that we really destroyed the world, and the feeling of arrogance kept haunting him all his life. This movie is as sweet as it is, but it is dark and depicts the black history of mankind. Not only the future is the one that is full of injustice and corruption, not the past. I was afraid that he would fall into the point of drumming for America and filming it in the role of angel, like most directors, and I wanted him to at least take the field of neutrality, but it surprised me when he portrayed history as black as it is in the past after Germany's withdrawal and Hitler's suicide, and Japan was the salvation of itself, and this is how it will lose, but America also designed a nuclear strike to test it and show its strength."

10/10,Oppenheimer is a masterpiece....but,07 2023,I watched it on imax and This is one if not the best theatre experience that I've ever scene and i think at least you should watch it on a really biggest screen as possible because believe me this is a truly another experience that may have not seen before nolan storytelling on it's peak but I understand that this film may be not everyone cup of tea So don't be fool by any review you see You must watch it and make your own thoughts about it.
6/10,"Not Nolan's best work, but one to watch at least once",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
5/10,Unpopular view but very boring,07 2023,I expected a thriller and ended up with a drawn out boring court case unfortunately. There are elements of the film which are entertaining but the film's third act is very dull and far too long.
8/10,About as good as everyone is saying it is,07 2023,"Fantastic acting from top to bottom from a really good cast (Robert Downey Jr is all but unrecognizable, really great to see him lose himself in a role again). It's a compelling story. I can't claim to know anything about Robert Oppenheimer besides the history headlines, but it appears he was much more complex than the headlines would indicate. My only real complaint about this film is the score. I tend to love the scores of no Nolan's films, but this one is overbearing. It's too loud and intrudes on too many scenes. It's nearly constant, and that winds up detracting from the impact of some of the scenes, which, given how dramatic the score is, is exactly the opposite of what's intended. I found it pretty distracting, and a significant miscalculation. Nonetheless, this is one of those movies that everyone really ought to see. Side note about the story. I didn't really go into this knowing what to expect, but a significant part of the story and the plot center on the politics around the Manhattan Project during and after. This aspect of the movie for me was the most compelling part of it, in addition to oppenheimer's own grappling with the magnitude of what he had contributed to."
10/10,The masterpiece of the decade,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a captivating masterpiece that skillfully combines drama, history, and humanity. With stunning cinematography, powerful performances, exceptional score and sound design, and thought-provoking storytelling, it immerses viewers in the complex world of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film explores his personal journey, from leading the Manhattan Project to grappling with the moral implications of his scientific breakthrough. It raises profound questions about the consequences of scientific progress and serves as a reminder of the ethical dilemmas that accompany it. A must-watch for those intrigued by science, history, and the human experience."
10/10,A masterpiece of a film,07 2023,"This film is brilliant. The movie is 3 hours long but it felt more like 2 to 2 and a half hours. It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, and I definitely recommend to do a bit of research of who Robert. J. Oppenheimer was. It's also a film that you need to pay really close attention to, you could easily miss something. The audio is perfect and I didn't have any problems with hearing the voices of the characters, I watched this in IMAX by the way and I definitely recommend the reader to also watch it in this format. You can't expect action from this movie because if you do you will be disappointed, the film contains mostly scenes of the person's talking, but Nolan manages to even let scenes like this feel thrilling. The acting performance is magnificent, probably the best of 2023, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey jr. Were brilliant. The visuals were also very impressive considering the fact that they didn't use any CGI this whole movie. The fact is that this film is objectively good even though I'm not a film expert of any sorts, and I definitely recommend to watch it (In IMAX if possible)."
10/10,Tick Tick Boom,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan has delivered yet another cinematic masterpiece with this dark, poignant and powerful biopic of deeply flawed yet brilliant mind. Using Kai Bird's book ""American Prometheus"" as a platform, Nolan leaves the audience contemplating Robert's motivation as an American icon or Anti hero."
9/10,A powerful piece of storytelling,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors working today. Whenever his name is attached to a film, it always brings people to cinemas. I was a bit apprehensive at first with Oppenheimer since Tenet was underwhelming and since it was a biopic, something you would think Nolan wouldn't do. Yet he did and he pulled it off in spectacular fashion."
10/10,This is the most important thing!,08 2023,"I felt, from the point i entered this movie it was exceptional. Let's face it movies are getting longer, why? Not sure, still this one has so much depth and detail it really does not feel three hours. It warrants the runtime where so many have fallen way short."
7/10,Meh,07 2023,"Visuals, fantastic. Acting, great. Plot, lacklustre. Was a long watch being 3+ hours, could definitely have been portrayed closer to 2 hours instead. There's a lot of talking and for me, not enough concentrating on the physical creation of the bomb (which would break up all the talking scenes). I also didn't really notice a massive difference in IMAX to that of a standard showing, bar the 'bomb' scene. It's a worth a watch once but won't go back for a second viewing. Definitely my least favourite film from Nolan unfortunately."

10/10,An Explosive Victory for Nolan,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer may be the most expertly crafted and intelligent movie I've seen in the past decade. The scope of the film was ambitious, but if there's anyone that can do it, it's Christopher Nolan. The visuals are almost all practical and it pays off, this movie is stunning to look at from the first frame to its last. The cinematography also plays a part in this. The cast, acting, and dialogue are all perfectly selected, acted, and written. Specifically, the acting from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh are all phenomenal. The pacing is fantastic though once you get to the court scenes towards the end of the movie it can drag a little, but it's nothing drastic The message of the movie being ""just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should"" is perfect for Robert Oppenheimer's story. The movie is great in IMAX just like Nolan promised, though I don't believe it is necessary to get the full experience of the movie like he said. The reality is, I don't see any obvious negatives to this film so this is a rare 10 out of 10 movie for me, and I hope everyone gets to go see it."
9/10,One of the best films of the year,07 2023,"If you're going in expecting an action heavy film filled with explosions, then this probably isnt for you. The film is centered around a trial against Oppenheimer and is mostly told through flashbacks. One through the biased POV of Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and through Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy). The film is long - and also feels very long. So you definitely have to be in the right mindset to sit down and watch. But I really enjoyed watching this exploration of this man and his psyche. The film poses a lot of questions about whether one should have this power. And it actually made me want to read a biography about him."
10/10,Christopher Nolan finally gives Cillian Murphy the lead role to excel,08 2023,"Oppenheimer review- 5/5 One word to describe this film, breathtaking. This film skilfully combines all elements of audio, acting, direction and how the design of each scene looked to make it an unforgettable cinematic experience that is made to be seen on the big screen in imax"
10/10,AMAZING MOVIE,07 2023,"This movie brings people to life! This movie made me feel like I was part of the whole story! If you go and watch it, please watch it in IMAX, cause the whole movie brings everything in the whole industry in prospective! I loved the performance of every single one of the actors/actresses and I think the whole cast is chosen precisely and perfect for the whole movie's context! I loved the whole history lesson lol, but I loved the most the thought of our scary world that we live in! We have to think more about the people in the world, than ourselves and other opinions and the light of the projectors! Go and watch it! You won't regret it!"
8/10,"Nolan tried to be an adult, but still under performed",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Is this really a movie about the bomb?,09 2023,"For me I heard a different story. I revived the terrible tragedy of mad men trying to take over the world and leaving the task to fight tirany to the ""new kid on the block"", the USA. The then 160 year old country which was founded with high moral values became the strongest of all countries thanks to the commitment of all its citizens always upholding right from wrong, good vs bad. Moral & immoral! Sadly this is not longer true. If today's society is challenged in the way it was back in the 40's we would become a chaotic mass of crybabies, finger pointing chickens blaming whoever is weak. Nolan sets up this giant explosive alarm clock which may and probably not awaken our souls drowned in consumerism while the rest of the world led by corrupt socialists succumbs to poverty. Is there a way to really ""Make America Great Again""? The ""new kid"" became a weak fat couch potatoe not able to vanish even a Maduro!"
8/10,Not his best,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
7/10,Missed too much,08 2023,"The first 2/3 of the Oppenheimer film was way too slow and the film, in general, focused too exclusively on his unjust persecution resulting in his loss of high level security clearance. While this is a story, it is not the only story of the man and his times. Lost in this narrow focus is the compelling story of the race between Allied and German scientists to perfect the nuclear bomb, which caused once collegial physicists to restrict their open sharing of ideas with former colleges. Werner Heisenberg was in the German camp. Neils Bohr and Oppenheimer in the Allied camp. I commingling of these themes would have made for a richer more complex story and would have highted the injustice done to Oppenheimer in the face of his fealty to the Allied cause."
4/10,"""Oppenheimer"" didn't resonate with me",07 2023,"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is one of the most hotly anticipated movies of 2023... for reasons I don't really understand. Screenings nationwide are selling out, thanks in part to the recent #Barbenheimer double feature craze; critics and audiences are raving about the film, flocking to see it in Imax; but what is it exactly about the film that has people in such a frenzy? I wish I knew, because to be quite honest, ""Oppenheimer"" didn't resonate with me."
9/10,"""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds""",07 2023,"Well paced and deftly edited, ""Oppenheimer"" is a suspenseful drama on the legendary physicist's creation of the atom bomb and its world-shattering implications. Cillian Murphy portrays a wide-eyed eccentric Oppenheimer who juggles the challenges of his personal and professional life where his political affiliations clash with the patriotic nature of his work leading to his later troubles with the law. An all star cast including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek round up an impressive work. With its unflinching look at war, politics and arms ""Oppenheimer"" raises the issues on the thin line between pragmatism and morality. One of the best films of the year, this is a must see."
10/10,Phenomenal,07 2023,"I Don't Understand Why People Think Its A Boring Movie When In Reality Its Not, The Movie Delievers A Series Of Entertainment And Excitement During Alot Of Scenes Specially That Bomb Test, I Don't Have Words To Describe How Good The Cinematography Was, There Are Alot Of Memorable Scenes In This Movie That You Just Cannot Forget My Honest Opinion On This Is That Its A Wonderful Movie And I Really Recommend It To Watch It In Cinemas Cause Of The Feel And Experience Cillian Murphy Stole Everyone's Heart In This Movie His Acting Was Next To Perfect And The Side Acters Also Did Well All The Dialogues, Scenes, Its Just Amazing. I Really Think Its One The Greatest Work Of Christopher Nolan"
10/10,The most important film of the current century.,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,"Flawless, but not one of his best.",07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a great film by any standard. Important subject matter. Good script. Fantastic cast. Brilliant acting. Cillian is killing it, and pretty much every supporting actor performs beautifully. The special effects are impressive."
9/10,Phenomenal,07 2023,"Just walking out of the theatre after watching the double feature #Barbenheimer. The two-hour movie was awful. AWFUL! I'm so glad I got to see that one first because the three-hour movie...aka Oppenheimer...was genius. Absolutely phenomenal. I will have to see it again to clear up in my mind which guys was which scientist. Einstein (obvious, of course) was a glorious character (as he was in real life), so I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Conti's portrayal of him. I am a huge fan of Matthew Modine - what a gift to see him on the big screen again. Gary Oldman is unreal (and unrecognizable) as Truman. Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Downey's (Strauss') advisor (don't know who the actor is) steal the last 25 minutes of the show. Wonderful work all around!"
7/10,Telling the life of a scientist (almost) without science,07 2023,"This is a good movie. With the typical non-linear narration of its director Nolan, and despite certain self-indulgence, also classic in its creator, the film never bores at any moment, although I believe it is a challenging watch and it's not for everyone."
9/10,The suspence and mental struggles come out on screen.,07 2023,"Absolutely brilliant portrayal of, well, everything. The powerful mental battles are the best ever place on screen. The music adds to this experience in a way that has never hit you this hard. And I mean HIT. Physical sound is incredible. Any movies that makes your smart watch tell you to calm down it's worth watching."
6/10,Mediocre misuse of concept for a historical film,07 2023,"Dunkirk was such an extraordinary film visually and in the the story telling, so appreciately not overly sentimental or jingoistic. Oppenheimer, in contrast was just not that appealing and certainly less than the sum of its many many parts and ultimately is a disservice to the extraordinary moment which brought together so many extraordinary people together for better or worse in The Manhattan Project. As many others have stated this film was overhyped as something that must be seen on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. For one absent one scene and a few 30 second cuts, there's nothing so requiring that type of scale. It's largely an office drama with an identity crisis. Sadly enough also, just oscar clickbait because this really wastes opportunities to delve into the imaginative scientific minds, the think tanks at Princeton, University of Chicago, UT-Knoxville, Bay area Universities, the strong european tradition that most of Manhattan Projects braintrust came from, or Oppenheimer's own personal upbringing, anything to reveal what made the subject tick and become the leader of such a weighty doomsday project. It also wasted the resource of an amazing amount of acting talent to no point. For despite everything that occurs in three hours the impression you are left with is that somehow the point of all of this is to produce The Richard Strauss Show by way of several minutes of Florence Pugh being provocatively naked and intellectual randomly with great lighting and makeup."
3/10,20 minutes of suspense surrounded by 160 minutes of boredom,08 2023,"If you're expecting the next best Nolan thing next to unforgettable greats like Dark Knight or Inception, chances are you're gonna be sorely disappointed with this one."
8/10,Requires Multiple Viewings,07 2023,Watched this film in 15/70 IMAX which is the way the film is suppose to be watched. Did it make a difference? Sort of. It is immersive. But that could be a testament to its editing. It's fast paced for a story that seems to be slow paced.
10/10,Cinematic experience that was much needed!,07 2023,"This has to be experienced in a cinema with high quality sound system. The sound plays a crucial role in the experience of watching this non-stop high paced movie. The movie is 3 hours long but did not feel like it, in fact I was surprised when it finished. It is a classic hit and keeps you on the edge of your sit. I would give the movie itself 9/10 but because of the amazing visuals plus sound editing, the cinematic experience elevates it so gets a rare 10/10 for me. The acting is superb. Murphy and RDJ give monstrous performances. If indeed Nolan is planning on making biographies, I am really looking forward to watching them because this was the best Nolan movie so far, well The dark knight has a special place in my heart but this was an intense experience for sure."
8/10,Nolan being Nolan... even with a boring Biopic,07 2023,"Oppenheimer was by far the movie I looked forward to the most this year. To see a Christopher Nolan film is to know that you are going to find a story that plays with its timelines, with deep and complex characters and a dense environment, among other things. Well, this time, Nolan lives up to his standards and delivers us a full-blown movie. However, as much as I hate to see a movie with expectations, whether good or bad, it seems to me that despite all the hype surrounding Oppenheimer, the movie falls short in some key elements."
10/10,Will anyone beat this at Oscars ..,07 2023,As a fan of both Cillian and Nolan sir ..this films brings the joy of watching a super grand historic saga in the cinema halls ... Oppenheimer has made me travel 250 kms for IMAX ...as i know if i miss this i will not be able to forgive myself .. This film not only makes u at the edge of the seat knowing all the outcomes but also makes ur ears focussed on the exceptional dialogues and bg score . Not forgetting the performance given by RDJ ..he has given one of the best performances in his career ...This film is not only a treat to watch but also shows how The Great Robert Oppenheimer was cheated by his own countrie's pitty politics .. People are saying this is a long movie but watching it never made me feel about the duration of this masterpiece.... and is one of the best casting made for each and every role ...I am sure about watching it again 😍
10/10,Oppenheimer Review,07 2023,This is my most anticipated film of 2023 for a single reason and that reason is Christopher Nolan. He is easily my favorite director and when I saw the first trailer for this film I was stunned. I have not seen many new releases this year but from what I have seen this film is the best by far and when Oscar season rolls around this is going to win everything.
7/10,Interesting But Slow,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
2/10,I never wanted to walk out of the theater my whole life,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,"Excellent movie, but read the history first",07 2023,People don't usually sit through the credits here. The entire IMAX movie theater sat quietly after this one.
10/10,"Fast paced, cinematic, beautiful.",07 2023,"""Wow"" - My exact sentiment as soon as the credits rolled. Nolan is truly a master film maker, this movie truly was an experience to be had only in the cinema."
10/10,A Master Class in Filmmaking,07 2023,I went to the 10:45PM showing in IMAX and was surprised that it was nearly sold out.
8/10,"Worth the watch, with a few let downs",07 2023,"I walked out of Oppenheimer satisfied, but with many questions and ears slightly more deaf than when I walked in. I was looing forward to seeing this movie since last year, and could not wait to go and view it. However, there are a couple things that decreased the enjoyment of this movie for me."
9/10,Sealing the fate of mankind is Oppenheimer in the most important film from Christopher Nolan.,07 2023,"It took nine seconds to decimate the city of Hiroshima with just one first generation atom bomb. That was in 1945. Today, and as of January 2023, there are over 12,500 advanced nuclear warheads around the world. Relating that fact to the review of this film, it doesn't matter whether the atom bomb was invented or the ability to split the nucleus of an atom was discovered. If we could put the knowledge of weaponizing atomic energy into a box, lock it and through away the key, we would still have a huge problem; because the name on that box would read - Pandora."
10/10,Most intense movie in last 10 years,07 2023,"This movie is the most intense movie i have seen in a theatre. The whole 3 hours felt so intense. Even the interrogation scenes were near perfect dialogues. I didn't felt a single scene was forced or amateurish. Coming to acting, Cilian Murphy delivers his career best performance, and Matt Damon was extraordinary and Robert Downey might have given his best acting till date. Even without a single fight scenes, Nolan has made this more interesting than most of superhero movies. I think the dialogues deserve extra credit. Reminds me of watching 'The godfather' movie which had perfect dialogues. Definitely this one tops Dunkirk and Tenet, but I can't really compare this with Interstellar, prestige and inception, because of difference in genre."
7/10,"Well done, but so much for one film",08 2023,"I am a Christopher Nolan fan, and I think this film is a very important story, and was happy that this movie was made. It's definitely well done, and the acting is terrific. I think, however there is so much to cover in the story that a mini series on HBO or Netflix or something like that would have given the appropriate time to cover everything in a clearer fashion. I had previously read the biography on Oppenheimer, which was an excellent book, highly recommend. And my girlfriend, and I went to this movie, she was lost for most of the movie, I followed everything well, but I think it would've been difficult at times I had I not read the book. Specifically the first third of the movie when they cover a lot of Events and material in a fairy quick and almost choppy fashion. The middle third of the movie where they are at Los Alamos is rushed and there is so much to tell about that. And there's just not enough time in a three hour movie. So I give this movie a seven which is probably the lowest I've rated a Christopher Nolan movie simply because , there's too much content for three hour movie, even though I think he did as well of a job as could be done by anyone really."
2/10,If you have ADHD.... watch this film.,09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Watch it in IMAX,07 2023,"This movie can be easily called a masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Though this is a well-known and well-documented story, I think the way it was presented by the director is jaw-dropping. Never in the entire running time of this movie, I felt bored. All the characters essayed the roles in a beautiful way too. Cillian Murphy looked and acted really like Dr. Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr.'s role as Lewis Strauss is a class apart too. From the promotions of this film, I thought Robert Downey Jr. Would play a side role, but his role was almost as important as the lead character in this movie. Nolan's play with the black-and-white scenes and their interplay with the chromatic scenes seem like a genius move. I would suggest people to watch it in IMAX, if possible."
10/10,"The Federal Government Is, Was, and Will Be In Itself Coherently Pathetic",09 2023,"Screenplay 10; Direction 10; Actors - all of them a 10; Story Development 10; Ability of Film to Retain Your Attention 10; Academy Awards - should be several of them. If there were anything that could be considered negative with this theatrical presentation it would be its length, however, you will not be disappointed with its length due to its ability to tell the story completely, accurately, and hopefully truthfully -- just be sure to sit in a comfortable chair. If you do not see the actual point of this story (see the title of this rating) then you would be one of those on the ""commission"" investigating the political viewpoint of those employed in the Manhattan Project."
8/10,"Nolan makes the audience think, like the ending of Inception.",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,An epic drama,07 2023,"This movie was so interesting and engaging to watch and you don't know how 3 hours went. The story, the depiction of events, the performances by the cast members, the direction, the screenplay, the BGM, the pacing; everything were great. You can't find a single error in this movie except visuals but you don't need those type of visuals in this type of movie. Christopher Nolan did it, he has shown us that he can make any type of movie either it be sci-fiction or historical drama."

8/10,Hold on to Your Oppenheimer Hat,07 2023,I have given it 8 out of 10 because it held my attention and was pretty good. But some things really annoyed me about it.
7/10,A fairly good movie but right now overrated,09 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,A True Classic of the Future,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,A Non-Stop Tension-Fuelled Trip,09 2023,"Pros: 1. Cillian Murphy (J. Robert Oppenheimer), Benny Safdie (Edward Teller), Robert Downey Jr. (Lewis Strauss), Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) and Jason Clarke (Roger Robb) are utterly phenomenal."
9/10,"I think this movie is perfect for today's audience, given the state the world is in now.",07 2023,"Before watching this movie, make sure you are rested and clear-headed. Oppenheimer is a drama/biography/history film like no other. You will be taken on a very fast paced journey and learn about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and how the atomic bomb was invented. You will be constantly bombarded (pun intended) with stunning acting and dialogue! No guns, no firefights, no monsters or Sci-Fi, and yet so extremely thrilling!"
10/10,"""I Am Become Death, The Destroyer Of Worlds""",07 2023,"He was deemed ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb""-a man whose core studies on the nature of the universe and the atom itself led to the development of the ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction; and in his life, he was accused of being a Communist, particularly after his invention (or two of them) atomized Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was J. Robert Oppenheimer (or ""Oppie"" to his ""fans"" in the world), But while his story is fairly well known to anyone who has studied the history of America from World War II through to the Cold War, it took British director Christopher Nolan to truly bring his epic story to the big screen, which he has done so with OPPENHEIMER."
10/10,One of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time! Nolan's magnum opus.,08 2023,"I've been trying to write something about this thing for a few weeks now. Ever since watching it for the first time, it completely stuck with me. Oppenheimer simply is a ridiculous achievement in filmmaking. An absurdly immersive and heart-pounding experience. Cillian Murphy is an insane force and RDJ will be a front-runner for Best Supporting Actor. Every 10 minutes a new A list Hollywood star comes on screen and gives their lifetime performance - this is what it means to all of them being part of this masterpiece."
7/10,Christopher Nolan's Cinematic Bomb Blasts On And Off Screen,07 2023,Oppenheimer (2023) : Movie Review -
9/10,"An excellent film, but not for everyone",08 2023,"A masterpiece for those who understand the historical context of the film. Even with its three-hour runtime, it has a quick pace introducing characters and themes, making it a little dense at times. The script and storytelling are brilliant and engaging. Nolan's ability to turn a biopic into a deeply emotional cinematic experience shows why he is one of the best. There were moments when my heart was pounding and I even had goosebumps. The cast is one of the most ambitious aspects of the project, even secondary characters were played by recognized actors. Everyone delivers excellent performances, and I can already see Robert Downey Jr. Winning an Oscar for supporting actor. Visual and sound effects are captivating and immersive, even more so when you know the film does not have a single CGI shot. On top of all, Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack shows why he can be at the same level as Zimmer if he didn't already convince you with Tenet. Overall, an extraordinary experience in which you can feel how passionate were the people involved in the making of the film. Every aspect of it shines and blends remarkably to result in an emotional journey and I am sure it will have a lot of rewatch value as is usual with Nolan."
6/10,Great acting and directing attempt to make a boring story exciting,07 2023,"I love Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy, plus I'm a physics nerd so I was looking forward to this movie more than any other in recent memory. Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time partially because the focus on science, namely quantum mechanics and general relativity (and our inability to rectify them)."
3/10,Can't justify the lenght,08 2023,"The tension grows for a while but then it feels we never reach a climax that a 3 hour long movie would suggest. If you are ready to learn about the politics of the time mostly via dialogs, this movie may be for you. Nolan's work was always visually inspiring as well and had a good balance between dialogue, action and visuals. In this case the balance felt off. It's like one of those extended director's cuts when they really try to include everything even tho it comes with the loss of momentum. It's still an interesting film, but it feels that the shared premiere date with mainstream Barbie movie has created a bigger hype for Oppenheimer as well than the film actually deserves."
10/10,Phenomenal achievement,07 2023,Oppenheimer is a mesmerizing film from start to finish. Superbly directed and cut the movie makes sense of a complicated American genius. From its visceral sound track and visuals to the tremendous acting of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. The three hour run time flys by. The cast is a veritable who's who of great actors. Emily Blunt is also astonishing as Kitty Oppenheimer.
10/10,Maybe Nolans best work,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is based on a real story but that story is so well produced in the movie that it almost feel like a sci-fi. One characteristic that Nolan movies usually have is that they are high paced and really pulls you right in. His movies are usually very long but they don't feel like they are when they are exciting the entire time, and how he managed to pull it off in a 3 hour long real story is really why this should be considered a masterpiece."
10/10,I tend to agree with all of the people saying that . . .,08 2023,". . . OPPENHEIMER is a virtual remake of the 1900's classic picture, AMADEUS. Both films are about somewhat obscure title characters whose mastery of numeric sciences are hampered by flagrant dalliances with wanton women. Each of these protagonists have notable face-to-face disagreements with their nation's heads of state. Both of them are bedeviled by nefarious mortal enemies invented to advance their movie's plots. In fact, the Salty dude from the earlier film is played by a seeming twin to Murray Abraham in the current exploration of masculine famous envy. AMADEUS and OPPENHEIMER both run about three hours, and each tale traces the decline of the titular leads, depicting their declining mental health, decaying physical constitutions and increasingly frequent hallucinations. AMADEUS won eight gelded statuettes, including the 1984 Best Picture prize. Can OPPENHEIMER top that? Stay tuned."
10/10,Fantastic,07 2023,Nice powerful drama for 180 minutes You don't feel bored
8/10,"The bomb, the fear, and the aftermath.",08 2023,"I'd be lying if I said that I did process and understand all of the dialogues and situations all the time throughout the movie, or I cared 100% about everything happening in the last act of the movie."
10/10,Not the usual Christopher Nolan movie,07 2023,"This film is pure cinema. Its the perfect combination of brillant story telling and outstanding performances. Its not just about the making of bomb. Its more about the politics that played around it. Some of the shots are so brilliant that you feel like you are actually in the film and it feels like it should never end. Looking at the reviews from everyother platform, you might as well know about the performance of Cillian Murphy. No doubt its one of the best character display I have ever seen, but for me the impact which Robert Downey Junior makes, is worth a special mention. Overall the movie is a great experience and if you wish to watch it, watch it only in IMAX. You will not regret it."

10/10,A captivating and complex film about one of the history's most influential figures,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
6/10,Christopher Nolan's odd choices ruined the movie once again,07 2023,"I'm beginning to think that Nolan has self-esteem issues and desperately tries to prove how deep, special and different he is. Hey look! Non-linear structure of the story to confuse you! Deafening sound mixing to destroy your ears! And no CGI! Can you imagine that bro? A modern film with no CGI! That's how special Nolan tries to be! By the way, there is CGI in the movie. They just lie to him that it's all VFX compositing of photoreal elements."
10/10,Worthy of numb backside.,08 2023,"I haven't been in the cinema much in last several years, but I wasn't sorry of 3 hours spent on it, and I'm glad I didn't wait for it to come to streams. I want to praise Murphy, but it wouldn't be fair to others, because all of them have done amazing work with this one. Answered so many questions I was always wondering about Manhattan project, about organization, and state of mind of these people. And how did they feel when they've seen results of it. It also shows how American politics can easily turn a hero into a villain, and how little common sense means in that surrounding."
8/10,Oppenheimer Was A Terrific Movie Overall With Some Flawed,07 2023,"8.5/10 Let's talk about the flaws right away, i did feel the length of the film in all three act especially in the first and second act mostly the build up to the Trinity climax, i thought they added a bit too much, they're definitely missing some one and two key figure and scene that i felt was important to be included in the movie, i actually fine with how they dealt with the Hiroshima and Nagasaki scene, and that's about it really, Oppenheimer was definitely a movie that you have to watch in IMAX, the sound, the color, the resolution, and of course the size of the screen, it is a very fascinating story directed by one of our beloved and best movie director's right now, played so incredibly well by Cillian Murphy, calling Oscar's best actor nomination already, a 3 hours epic biopic that is unique and i've never seen before, i was engaged by the story the whole time, and while i can see lot's of people will mixed about it, well i recommend you to at least read the story before just so you know a little bit of background, then you can at least appreciate it, what Nolan does with Oppenheimer is his way of narrating the film was just terrific, again added with terrific performance by all the cast, the beautiful practical effects and the way they edited it was incredible, overall Oppenheimer was indeed a terrific movie, despite the flaws of a missing key figure and scene and phasing, i was still entertained, i was still engaged, i was still blown away, and i was still amazed by the movie."
8/10,Good stuff!,08 2023,"This, just like Barbie, wasn't what I thought it would be, not the traditional Nolan film that you'd expect. For a while, I wondered if it's okay to say ""Anybody could make this, I expected something different from Nolan"" but the more I thought about it, I think this is directorial awesomeness*."
10/10,Ignore the haters and their 1-star reviews. They either haven't seen the film or they are not intelligent enough to understand a film made for an intelligent audience.,07 2023,I will keep it brief.
9/10,"Oppenheimer"" takes you on a guilt trip through the mind of a scientist.",07 2023,"I just had to share my thoughts on ""Oppenheimer."" In my opinion, it is hands down the best film of 2023 so far, truly ending the first half of the year with a bang. For the past three months, I've been yearning for some quality content, but most movies have been either too commercial or just plain lackluster."
10/10,A haunting and beautiful piece of story telling.,08 2023,"This is the pinnacle of modern filmmaking; everything from the stacked cast, the acting, the cinematography, the brooding score, and the editing all shines through and immerses you into the world of Julius Robert Oppenheimer. It's the culmination of Nolan's success; everything he's achieved has led to this moment, and my goodness, what a beautiful, haunting ride it was. It captivates you from the very first frame and doesn't release you from its vice-like grip until the end, leaving you speechless, in awe, and haunted by what you experienced."
7/10,Oppenheimer bombed a bit,08 2023,"All the visual excitement, which is why I wanted to see Oppenheimer on the cinema big screen, was pretty much shown in the trailer. The film was far too talky. The usual polished performances, particularly from Robert Downey Junior and Cillian Murphy, but I think the story was so politically focused and not enough emphasis was given to showing the impact and fallout of the Hiroshima & Nagasaki bombings. Surprised no actual footage or reconstructions were used. Also a Japanese perspective would have added another dimension. In my opinion it ranks below Nolan's great direction, namely Interstellar, The Dark Knight and Memento. 7/10."

10/10,The bomb,08 2023,"Forget what I said about Barbie, for now, Oppenheimer is the best movie of 2023, beating out such masterpieces such as Barbie and Across the Spider-Verse, Christopher Nolan is one of the best working directors of our time, with classics like Memento, The Dark Knight, Interstellar, and Inception."
8/10,You'll feel it in your bones,07 2023,"A dense, slow-burn but undeniably a master class in filmmaking. The cast is full of stars who all do some of their best work. The sound, score, & editing are all amazing & create a very tense tone from start to finish."
10/10,Grabs hold and demands that you keep up.,07 2023,"Before going to see Oppenheimer I would strongly advise looking up some background information on Oppenheimer's life beforehand. This film is not interested in hand holding or dumbing information down, nor is it interested in relaxing its pace so that those without at least some prior knowledge of the subject can catch up. This film moves at a cracking pace, effortlessly blending different time lines and events in a brilliantly crafted story that contains some of the best acting I've seen since Sir Anthony Hopkins took home the Oscar for The Father. Cillian Murphy is almost transcendental as J Robert Oppenheimer, so far does her disappear into the character. The rest of the cast is entirely on point as well, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking at points, and the soundscape is incredible. I kept waiting for the point where I'd feel as if I was watching a 3 hour film, and it never came, that is how engaged I felt with this movie."
9/10,"Exceptional, a tour de force for both Nolan and Murphy",08 2023,"The first expectation that was shattered on my viewing of Oppenheimer, was that it would be more or less an ordinary life story of the scientist, albeit told in a much better fashion by venerable Christopher Nolan. The movie manages however to be something more than that. First off, even despite Murphy's career-defining performance where I forgot he was ever anyone else but J. Robert Oppenheimer, it is incredible work on part of just about every actor in what almost seems an ensemble cast. That last observation alone is probably due to Nolan's masterful work though, but regardless, the result is stellar on that front. Next, for my part, I quite liked the somewhat non-linear storytelling, may I say I found it pleasantly engaging when telling about the man who was wrestling at a frontier of science now known as quantum mechanics. To put it another way, Oppenheimer appears deliberately ""chaotic"" at times, like it's simulating miniscule particles that make up the A-bomb, but it aims to do so at viewer's pleasure. Third, I appreciated Nolan telling the story in no small part through what was straight out interviews of Oppenheimer by his then-contemporaries. It's admittedly hard to put into words exactly how he enriched the movie through that particular aspect of it, but I just found it so rewarding watching members of Congress and other interview boards etc, talk to Oppenheimer and hear his responses, all through something else than a documentary, mind you. Nolan pulled a hat-trick there, no less. That's what I mean by him making something _more_ than just a good biography movie. At times, he wants to portray America v. Oppenheimer kind of story, and it's done oh-so-well you can barely notice it until later and how great it was that he did it. Last, but not least, the movie is masterfully shot and cut."
7/10,"We all love Nolan's films, but this wasn't his best",07 2023,"As a fan of Nolan's films, it is really hard to criticize his work because so many of his previous works are honestly quite amazing."
8/10,It's a Blast,07 2023,"Being one of my most anticipated films of 2023, I wasn't disappointed."
6/10,A Classic or just Hollywood Hype?,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
5/10,YAWN,07 2023,Christopher Nolan's incessant use of suspenseful music is a crutch heavily leaned on in Oppenheimer. It seems as though the filmaker believes that bombarding the audience with intense musical cues will create an illusion of tension and excitement. However it becomes evident that the music is attempting to compensate for what is simply a very boring story line!
9/10,May Be Nolan's Best,07 2023,"Directing great, Christopher Nolan, is back with his vision, of how the events of the Manhattan Project, resulted in the creation of the atom bomb. Nolan film alumnus, Cillian Murphy, plays the titular character in this film, J. Robert Oppenheimer. This film has a great cast in it, which incudes Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves. It is a role originally done by Paul Newman, in the slightly criticized, but still worthy motion picture, about those events, in Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Oppenheimer (2023), also utilizes the great acting prowess of Iron Man, Robert Downey JR., as Lewis Strauss. Nolan film alumnus, Gary Oldman, gives another brilliant performance as Harry S. Truman."
10/10,"5,4,3,2,1...",07 2023,"An eye-opening historical epic that not only takes the audience on a character driven journey into the psychology of America's very own Prometheus, but also an inquisitive commentary that places viewers in the witness stands, whilst Nolan expertly questions the morality, and ethics, of America's power driven politics."
10/10,This is an instant classic,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Audiovisually breathtaking multi-themed conversational biography,09 2023,"Nolan plays with non-linear narrative, imagery and genres, yet his film remains easy to follow almost the entire time."
10/10,Absolutely Awestruck,07 2023,"Writing this right after leaving the theater, I am absolutely awestruck at the masterpiece I just witnessed. A brilliant and fast paced movie throughout, this movie truly showcases just how good of a writer Nolan is. No other Nolan movie features this much dialogue and reminded me that Nolan's writing is often overshadowed by his directing skills. That being said, I do believe this film features his greatest directing ever. The acting was superb as Cillian Murphy turns in his best performance yet and was able to shine in nearly every scene of this 3 hour epic. The whole supporting cast was great with wonderful cameos all throughout, but I believe Robert Downey Jr. Deserves praise especially. The score perfectly encapsulates the intense nature of the film and even the sound mixing was spot on as my theater was genuinely shaking. The cinematography even rivals that of other impressive Nolan pictures such as Interstellar. This movie was very dense despite being 3 hours long and was truly the fastest 3 hours has ever felt as I still wanted more. This movie is thrilling throughout and will never leave you bored. Being a Nolan film, expect timelines to jump from one point to the next, but I think the way this was edited is truly his best work. I want to take more time to determine where this will fall on my rankings of Nolan's movies but already I know it's top 3. Any Nolan fan knows that being in the top 3 for this list means it is brilliant given the stiff competition. To see this film, myself and a few other Nolan fans were incredibly hyped for this movie for over a year and even drove an hour and a half away to see this movie on an IMAX screen. I now understand why it was so important to witness this spectacle as such because I have never felt more immersed in a movie before. Without a doubt a masterpiece and a perfect 10/10, do yourself a favor and find the biggest screen possible and let yourself be blown away from start to finish. This is Nolan at his finest."
10/10,Atomic movie making,08 2023,"To begin with, Robert J Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project, famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita after witnessing the first successful nuclear explosion at the Trinity test site in Los Alamos New Mexico. He said, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"". Intentionally or unintentionally, he was just doing his karma, but the consequences were enormous as we have encountered in the past and possibly will in the future."
9/10,Incredible,07 2023,"(9.7) A near perfect film and easily one of the best films I've ever seen. The cast is amazing and each actor performs like they never have before, particularly Murphy and Downey. The tone of the film transforms with the plot throughtout and the movie is plauged with themes of guilt that are expertly shown through Nolan's Directing and Cillian's acting. Towards the second half of the film the directing almost has a kind of aspect of horror. The film might be 3 hours but it does not drag at all and it leaves you wanting more by the end. The best scene is the scene containing the detonation of the atomic bomb."
6/10,Disappointing with respect to the hype (6.5),09 2023,"So, yesterday, I watched ""Oppenheimer"". After seeing reviews online (just below 9), which is similar to an all time favourite and fantastic movie ""Shawshank Redemption"" (with just above 9), I was indeed very excited to see it. Most of my friends loved it too. The only reason I didn't watch it immediately after it came out was because I thought I would be too homesick for the physics world, so I wasn't brave enough (I am a physicist by education)."
4/10,OPPEN-HYPE-MER,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Best movie I have seen in many years!,08 2023,"Murphy is exceptional, the movie is amazing. Bot everyone will understand or like this movie, but for who wants to see a masterpiece, than this is the movie to see."
10/10,What a mind blowing movie!,07 2023,"This movie had made me wonder so much more about Robert J Oppenheimer, what a man he was! This movie was just a masterpiece directed by a legend Christopher Nolan."
10/10,An epic character piece.....,07 2023,Christopher Nolan is the only filmmaker these days that can have a historical biopic open big in the summer movie season. This film is usually saved for an end of the year release to give it the best chance for Oscar consideration. It has been heavily marketed as an event film that needs to be seen in IMAX because Nolan filmed it with IMAX cameras. Even though I agree that the film seems big because of it's director and huge cast but as great as this film is it is much more a character driven film than it's being marketed as and that a good thing.
9/10,An outstanding portrayal of an amazing part of history,07 2023,"Got the chance to watch Oppenheimer in imax during a quick stopover in Vienna today. Nolan's characteristic multi timeline strikes in maybe his most perfect fashion yet, brought to life by one of the best (and absolutely stacked) casts I've had the joy to appreciate in a long time. It is more of an essay on humanity than anything else, leaving you sitting in your seat lost in thought long into the credits."
10/10,THIS IS EXCEPTIONAL,09 2023,I never expected two movies to be released in the same date but this movie had an exceptional story based on true events within J. Robert Oppenheimer's life. We get to see recognizable actors playing diffrent people.
7/10,The wrong story for the multiple timelines,08 2023,"Lots to love about this: the acting was superb and the complex career trajectory of Oppenheimer was fascinating - I had not realised what a stark shift in fortunes he had in the years after Los Alamos, when he fell out of political favour."
9/10,Oppenheimer is Challenging but so Good,08 2023,"I tried not to read or look too hard into Oppenheimer before seeing it in the theaters myself, which was good. The few folks that saw it fortunately didn;t have much to say about it except that it was long, but that had no impact on me because I always disregard those comments."
7/10,Longggggggg!,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
2/10,OPPEN-SHITER MORE LIKE,07 2023,"I for one can not understand how christopher nolan fools studio executives into giving him money to produce so many terrible films. If they would only give more money to the sound crew, they might not turn the bass subwoofer & one note drone volumes up to 11 & the dialogue down to 2, so that no one has a clue of what is being said or going on."
8/10,Christopher Nolan presents a riveting and gripping movie,08 2023,"Christopher Nolan movies are not always easy to watch and comprehend because of the complex structure of the narrative and a heavy emphasis on technology driven picturisation. This movie has garnered huge praise not only for its superb story telling technique but also for the IMAX format in which it is shot. Fans of Nolan will easily spot his signature touches like a non linear complex narrative, real/ virtual scenario, timeline shifts, superb cinematography, alternate use of color/ BW format, characters facing acute moral dilemma, effective use of background music etc etc."
8/10,Most talky Nolan film!!!,07 2023,This movie is arguably the Nolan film with more conversations than visual treatment. The movie is non-linear with a court room kind of trial at the main proceedings. Robert Downey Jr and Cilian Murphy are just too good for the roles.
10/10,Masterpiece.,08 2023,"I think we're all quite scared at the moment, aren't we?"
9/10,"Fine plot, good cast: yet too much sound/music effect",07 2023,The plot is fine both for insiders who roughly know the story of Oppenheimer's and some physics as well for others who just might enjoy the drama(s) evolving in a fine visual way with strong dialogues.
10/10,Christopher Nolan is the master!,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a magnum opus that showcases Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a filmmaker. Spanning four decades of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, the film masterfully weaves a scrambled chronology, captivating audiences with its absorbing narrative. Cillian Murphy delivers a mesmerizing performance, embodying Oppenheimer's complex and enigmatic persona. Nolan's monumentalist approach immerses us in the grandeur of the story, exploring the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work and the era's social complexities. The movie's visuals are a symphony of artistry, magnificently capturing the essence of the Los Alamos years and Strauss' sequences. With a stellar supporting cast, ""Oppenheimer"" ignites essential discussions that remain relevant today. Nolan's cinematic brilliance elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to a profound and timeless work of art, leaving a lasting impact on its audiences."
7/10,"Historically solid, but a bit too much Nolan",07 2023,"This is a fantastic bit of historical drama/biopic. The cast is universally flawless, and the film does an excellent treatment of the complex personalities involved. I thought they got Teller and Szilard particularly well, after Oppenheimer himself. They also did a great job with Bohr and Lawrence, and even the small bits of Feynman's history are easy to see here. If you know this topic from the histories that have been written of it, you will recognize everyone. I'm surprised to say that I found Damon to be the weakest in his portrayal of Groves, but that could be the writing, as Groves was both a famously difficult man to work with and an overweight slob of a human. It would be difficult for anyone except perhaps someone like John Goodman to portray him effectively."
10/10,Best Cinematic Experience Of My Life,07 2023,"I Had The Best Cinematic Experience Of My Life And Credit Goes To The Genius Christopher Nolan, As A Long Time Nolan Admirer I Had Huge Expectations Going In, But The Movie Exceeds My Expectations On Every Level. From The Very Start The Movie Grabs Your Attention and Never Lets It Go Till The Credits Roll. The Movie Is Lives And Dies On The Performance Of Cillian Murphy and He Carried The Audience Throughout The Movie, Murphy Nailed The Role Of The Complex Scientist In Every Possible Way. Every Cast Member Gave The Best Performance Of Their Career. The Soul Of The Movie Is It's Background Score. The soundtrack keeps you on the edge of your seats every moment no matter what's happening in the scene. The soundtrack speaks it's own language. At Last But Not Least This Movie would not be possible without the mind of Christopher Nolan."
6/10,An overrated snoozefest,07 2023,"I'm just coming from the cinema and boy, was this a drag. Long, dull and unexciting. You had one job, Nolan, do a great a-bomb explosion. Show, don't tell us how powerful it is. Show, don't tell us about the devastations in Japan. Show, don't tell us how remorseful Oppenheimer is after the bombings. It's all talk and nothing visually exciting to warrant a cinema visit. I'm not surprised by the low box office results of this movie. Sure, it's filmed well, lots of stars in it, but it's the wrong movie to make, it is very boring and way too long. We were 11 people, everyone was disappointed and one of the girls feel asleep multiple times, while others, including me, were constantly looking at their watches."
10/10,Christopher Nolan has done it again!!!,07 2023,"I still vividly remember watching ""Interstellar"" for the first time when I was 10 years old. I was captivated, not necessarily by the story - which I didn't fully understand at the time - but by the manner in which it was portrayed, and by the depth of emotion conveyed by the actors. My experience with ""Oppenheimer"" was similar. Although the movie initially captivated me, I found myself lost for about ten minutes due to my difficulties with English as a second language. However, the remainder of the film had me utterly mesmerized. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot; Nolan never disappoints."
8/10,The best version of Nolan,08 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a complete film, with three hours of little contemplation and a lot of dialogue that intertwine across various narrative lines: past, present, and future. The first standout aspect is the makeup. I was so immersed in the movie that I simply didn't realize that the feature includes actors like Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon. The actors are immersed in their characters. The cinematography of ""Oppenheimer"" is incredible, dark, and somber. The film's sound is spectacular, both in terms of mixing and editing. We feel the weight of each scene through sonic exploration, highlighted by a 20-minute sequence about the bomb test that is perfect; much of this is due to the sound quality. Another highlight in the artistic realm is Cillian Murphy's performance. The actor is completely absorbed by his character, which is visible through his performance, although some narrative choices don't explore this as they should. Although I'm not Nolan's biggest fan because his films are usually aesthetically untouchable and in terms of direction, his scripts often struggle to connect with the audience. They're so deep that they become shallow. However, in ""Oppenheimer,"" he manages to narrow this connection. The film could be more audacious at times, especially concerning the visceral consequences of an atomic bomb. Nevertheless, ""Oppenheimer"" is an almost perfect film, deserving an 8.5 out of 10."
10/10,8.6 is disgracefuly low,08 2023,"This movie shouldnt be anywhere bellow 9. Its cinematic masterpiece like no other. Once in a lifetime experience watching this in cinema. 180 minutes of constantly perfect dialogue crafted by Nolan with right amount of drama. Every actor, from Muprhy to all supporting cast ( which to be fair were all superstars) were absolutely briliant from minute one to last minute. Only thing I didnt like fully was visual effects of atomic bomb test. Nolan should use CGI partly to get that classic mushroom effect and to remove some of the black smoke which is produced by chemical reaction, not nuclear. Otherwise-perfection."
10/10,"Exceeded my expectations, wow!",07 2023,"Through this entire movie, I was on the edge of my seat. The acting, the cinematography, everything was perfectly done. The sound effects made it 10x better. Don't miss the chance to see it in a theatre since movies as good as they have become so rare, sadly."
6/10,its there,08 2023,"I honestly expected it to be a lot better. For me, it doesn't live up to the hype and the 10/10s."
10/10,One of the best Biographical movies of all time!!!,07 2023,"I watched this movie both in English and Hindi languages,and no doubt this could become one of the highest grossing R rated movies."
7/10,To Looooonnnngggg,08 2023,"A challenging film for sure... Not everyone's cup of tea.... I love a long and well layed film and I struggled with this one.. however I'm pleased I stuck with it.. not the best film I've ever seen.. not even the best this year, I have to say Mission Impossible was better or be it in different ways... But I stuck with it... Robert Downey Jr will win an Oscar for best supporting actor, im sure of that he was absolutely brilliant and Cillian Murphy will probably win the Oscar for his role in the film.. however I don't think it should get the nod for best film of the year, but it depends what's up against it... it"
1/10,"Boring, Overlong, Tedious",09 2023,Absolute tedious shite. Dont bother. I've NEVER before walked out of a film but after 1 hour of this 3+hr film Id had enough.
10/10,Another Win for Christopher Nolan,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan just gets it. I mean, that shouldn't be a surprise for anyone. He's proven time and time again why he's among the greatest filmmakers of this generation and Oppenheimer is another exhibit to his greatness. This was a complex story told ingeniously. Some people complain that it was too long, but I disagree wholeheartedly. In fact, I would argue that it could've even been longer!"
9/10,Superb casting and great story telling,07 2023,This is a long one and people who know my reviews will know I'm no fan of films longer than 2 hours and this one was 3 hours - realistically I could have and should have ended after 2.5 hours
10/10,Destructively Good,07 2023,"What a historical figure to make a biopic of, what a filmmaker who made it, what an actor who portrayed him. When filmmaking is good its power is immeasurable, not even in Gigatons. And this is good cinema, plain and simple. Using the medium of audio and visuals to elicit emotion in a meaningful way."
10/10,Exceptional Performances,07 2023,"This is a super intense, history-driven movie. It's a linear storyline which is good for a Nolan movie. The performances are phenomenal. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Will certainly get the Oscar awards. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett are all excellent as well. It kept my interest throughout the 3-hour run time and I learned so much about science and history that I did not know before. The storyline explaining how communism, science, and politics were so intertwined and were informing important decisions during the war, was super interesting. I highly recommend this film."
10/10,"If perfection were something from this world, it would certainly be directed by Nolan",07 2023,I don't even know where to begin.
6/10,Going against the grain here,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!,07 2023,First of all if you have a true IMAX cinema near you i would recommend that you go see this movie in that theatre.
6/10,Mediocrity at its best,07 2023,"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)"
9/10,"""Oppenheimer"" is an excellent film worth the hype surrounding it",09 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a movie telling the story of Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. It stars, among others, Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downy Jr., Florence Pugh, and is directed by Christopher Nolan."
9/10,It's not what I expected but is a great movie anyways,08 2023,"Nolan makes another excellent movie as expected and the quality is still outstanding, but this time is different, it's a biopic about a real person and some controversial themes and it somehow manages to keep the plot intriguing and building up conflicts that make interesting to know what's happening to the characters, it's very dynamic how a lot of characters are being presented in the movie by separate moments that connect through the storyline and how are represented the different personalities, it gives all the depth to Oppenheimer to see his development as a physician, politic and as a person with feelings but also gives the other characters the importance and exploration so they don't feel like just backgrounds characters and the cast fits great, the legal conflict is a part of the story that gives a bigger retrospective to the events and just a personal complaint it was longer than expected but it's supported by the surprising evolution of Lewis Strauss as an antagonist and the emotional side that is mainly revealed by Kitty Oppenheimer's character."
10/10,Give Nolan his deserved oscar,07 2023,"Wow, just wow. This will go down as one of the best films of the decade. The direction and screenplay is phenomenal by Nolan and it's about time he gets an Oscar for it."
9/10,Thrilling ride that has powerful imagery.,07 2023,"This movie is factually consistent, but is simplistic and more feeling on the science, but that is the intend. It shows the terror, power and beauty in fission explosion. It is very subjective telling of the events, and thus lends itself for artistic view on psyche and reality."
10/10,Cinematic Masterpiece,07 2023,"Oppenheimer had quite possibly the best cinematography of any movie I have ever seen. The visuals were outstanding. I was mesmerized as I watched every scene. This movie was filmed entirely in IMAX and the film stretched multiple miles long. The black and white scenes were also filmed in 70mm Black & White, which has never been used before. This is just the cherry on top of the cinematography."
10/10,Another Masterpiece of Nolan,09 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute gem of a film, earning its well-deserved 9/10 rating. The performances by the actors and actresses were simply outstanding, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. The cinematography was visually stunning, capturing the essence and intensity of the story. The director's genius shines through every scene, crafting a gripping and thought-provoking drama. The music added an extra layer of emotion, enhancing the overall impact of the film. It's safe to say that ""Oppenheimer"" is the best biography ever made, showcasing the incredible talent and dedication of everyone involved. A must-watch for fans of captivating storytelling and exceptional filmmaking! 🎥🌟🎬"
9/10,See it in cinemas,07 2023,This film is made for the big screen. The sound design and cinematography are so good that it's a physical experience that left me with goosebumps.
9/10,The blast that changed the world,07 2023,"As I sat in the emptied auditorium reflecting on the movie and would begin my car ride home. One word kept popping in my head, ""awe struck,"" but not of the film but rather of the history the film is portraying."
10/10,Alluring Jaw Dropper,07 2023,"Jaw dropping intensity and allure. A sequence filled with enigma. Sequences carefully curated in the highest quality. Filled with scenes and cinematic with the most delicate care, intrusive details, emotional intensity delivered in the most impactful way. Knowing little about the figure that is J. Robert Oppenheimer, or knowing far too much, this doesn't miss a dot. From perfect edge-of-seat timing, to precision of words and delivery by a profound set, this is an absolute homage to the complexity that makes this physicist and relative figures. Hero or villain, martyr or heathen, is beside every point, as this film goes to challenge every point of view and leaves a pondering, critical, thought provoking moment that in of itself leaves a most bittersweet feeeling."
5/10,All surface but no feeling,07 2023,"Nolan rarely does empathy well but this is a soulless three hours of men mumbling at one another. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are wasted and portrayed as damaged souls. Scenes come and go barely registering on your conscience. Watching this movie is a bit like thinking back to you time in school where you were forced by your teachers to watch educational videos which were kind of okay but you'd rather be playing Lego or riding your bike. That's what watching Oppenheimer is like. It's like a three hour lecture with a bit of sex thrown in. Yes, it's a competent artistic film but that doesn't mean it's that good."
9/10,Truly Epic,07 2023,"Nolan wastes none of the viewers time in throwing you into J. Robert Oppenheimer's world. Epic masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are the standouts. Along with Hoytema's cinematography and Göranssons spine-shaking score. The use of the black and white IMAX film is masterful. Although it is three hours, so, make sure your attention span is long and your brain is switched on. Pacing thought was not an issue due to the unbelievable tension. Nolan may just beat his ""not being able to write characters"" allegations. Though Oppenheimer is a real human which makes it easier. Watch this."
10/10,Oscar here you go...,07 2023,Exceptionally crafted movie with all sorts of Christopher Nolan's touches. Brilliant casting and scores were the key thing to experience from this movie.

10/10,The best movie I have ever seen,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Pure Cillian and Nolan Show!!,07 2023,Saw it in imax. I should admit that this is the best cinema experience I have in recent times. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is phenomenal. The screenplay is way ahead of what we predict but is not confusing. There are few scenes which are glued to my mind and are unforgettable. Every actor and actress have given their best. RDJ was so good as Strauss. This movie is definitely for the Physics freaks our there every scene is properly accurate to the theories and laws of the subject. The only issue is the length where I felt that easily at least 10 - 15 minutes could have been easily cut as they were kind of unnecessary to the film.
10/10,Honest Review.,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is the greatest cinematic experience I have ever had the chance to immerse myself in. It is an exceptional movie that gave me goosebumps and put me in a solid state of paralysis for 3 hours. Cillian Murphy's acting in this film is (beyond) Oscar-worthy. The visualization of the detonation of the atomic bomb was executed with uttermost brilliance and truly made me feel as if I am about to see with my own eyes, how perhaps one of the most dangerous weapons in the history of humankind is released into the world. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece and used IMAX technology like no other director has ever before."
7/10,Good but not great,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
3/10,Watch at home,08 2023,"The acting was great, but the story was disappointing. The first two hours covered nothing. We didn't learn anything about how they invented and created the bomb. The 3rd hour was good with the story of the politics and the hearings. Nothing has changed our government is just as corrupt as it was back then. Could have left out the sex and nudity as it served nothing to the story. People that gave this a high rating is questionable. And the directer advising people to see it on the biggest screan they can is also questionable. Why.. they showed one expolsion and I don't need to see boobs bigger than my hole body lol. The last hour is the only worthy part of this movie. Wait and watch it at home those 3 hours are LONG..."
9/10,my two cents,07 2023,"With over 1,900 reviews, do you need another one?"
10/10,The American Prometheus,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,insanely good,07 2023,Masterpiece from mr.nolan the direction of the film is amazing it is a bit confusing at first going into 3 timelines at the same time but it the film is so much fun when you realise it shortest 3 hours of my life enjoyed it so much just a complete masterpiece.
8/10,Exciting retelling of the story of a great historical event.,07 2023,"Two things got me into the theater. They were the interesting subject and curiosity about how such a story would be told. Plus the fear that this fun theatrical experience might tank before I got around to it. No worry, there. This is the stuff of legend, as it should be. This thought provoking movie tells us exactly why that is so. If you don't know anything about what happened prepare to be amazed. It is based on a book and reading history might also be something you would enjoy. I was a little surprised at the style. A little chaotic and loud. It all comes together, though. One character, an ordinary (seriously smart) man called by unusual circumstances to participate in one of the greatest events in contemporary history. It also tells why anyone would ever do such a thing, for it is quite awful in every sense. Anyway, if you can get past the effort to get us into Oppenheimer's head using weird graphics and strange musical effects, the somewhat altered depiction of real events in the interest of storytelling, and the three hour run time, you may find yourself rewarded with a first class entertainment."
9/10,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""",07 2023,FILM: 9/10.
6/10,Didn't match the expectations.,07 2023,"The internet created a huge hype about this movie. The Bomb and Nolan maybe the reason. In the movie, there was more dialogues (especially in the train which doesn't made any sense) than the making of the bomb. The cinematographer was descent and Nolan did well. Murphy carried the whole movie. There was some miscasts but overall an average movie. The bomb test was a great experience, didn't expected it. It was like a biopic and anyone cam enjoy the movie with proper knowledge about Oppenheimer. People may watch the movie more than one time to understand the storyline. Just have to say that people expected more from Nolan."
10/10,An Authentic Masterpiece of Human Exploration,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
7/10,I'd probably like it better without the hype,07 2023,"I try not to buy into hype. Rarely does a movie exceed high expectations. The Barbenheimer phenomenon basically ended in a thud for me: BARBIE was a horrendous toy commercial disguised as an existentialist statement, while OPPENHEIMER was competent Oscarbait enlivened only by a fantastic lead performance. Cillian Murphy deserves all the praise in the world for his delicate, almost Shakespearean work as the tragic Oppenheimer. He carried this movie like Atlas. The rest of the actors are great too (RDJ is a great antagonist). The visuals are fantastic, with Nolan using shallow depth of field to give the sense that the protagonist's world is closing in on him."
3/10,Disappointed,07 2023,"The acting was amazing, the cinematography was also amazing, but thats where the good ends and the bad starts. 3 hours are you kidding me? This story could have been done in an hour forty-five with credits. There was too much filler garbage i was immediately annoyed. Glorifying the smartest people creating the biggest bomb after the worlds best scientific discovery was sickening. I know that was true, but it made me sick. Showing how twisted and demented our government is was a great idea. There is literally too many things i want to say but don't know how to word them. I highly recommend everyone see something else and save a lot of time. Watch this at home after it hits netflix."
10/10,Speechless,07 2023,"This was one of those movies that leave you thinking and speechless at the end. Walked out of the theater and not one person said a word. Extremely, EXTREMELY compelling. The story was told in the greatest way possible. Thank you Nolan. Haven't been to the movies in roughly 8 years, to see this in Imax (digital cause the film reel broke but bought another ticket for 70mm in a week cause I am such a big fan of this film) was one of the greatest experiences a film nerd could've witnessed. The story telling, themes, plots, timing, was beyond perfect. Kept people wrapped to their seats until the very end."
8/10,A brilliant piece of art on first viewing. Rewatch needed,07 2023,They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand until they've rewatched it. First watch will take you only so far.
10/10,Explosions can look slower than they are (Rating: 10),07 2023,Let's be real. Everyone knew it was gonna be a 10. From the breathtaking visuals to the spectacular practical effects and incredible sound design; this film quite literally gives the audience everything.
10/10,Truly amazing,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,"Christopher Nolan makes his best film yet, as Cillian Murphy delivers with an outstanding performance",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
7/10,"Quality movie for sure, but a headache to watch",09 2023,"Disclaimer, I love Christopher Nolan's movies, he is absolutely brilliant. But for making a historical movie he is just not the right choice. The nonlinear storytelling that makes fiction stories awesome just isn't really a fit for recounting history. Oppenheimer, plus some of the greatest scientific minds of the XX century, and the history around them are, by themselves, fascinating. There was no need to do this confusing continuous jumps between I don't know how many timelines to make it great."
9/10,This is a history & philosophy lesson that endorses Nolan's range,08 2023,"Anyone expecting an Interstellar or Inception type movie from Nolan here, shouldn't. He does a tremendous job of demonstrating his range as a director. Pacing is perfect and it's a biopical/political/philosophical history lesson that inspires thought and debate about the human condition."
7/10,"Good, but somewhat overrated.",08 2023,"This is a thrilling movie. It is thrilling to see and hear explosions, to watch a person with profound talents create something in spite of its challenges, to watch them struggle with the gruesome results of their creation or genius."
9/10,I lost track of time,08 2023,"This film was structured so well, suddenly the movie was over. It's so complicated, but Nolan made it all logical, even though there are 3 timelines crossing each other. Don't get me started about the acting from Cillian Murphy, which was phenomenal. The music was great. It really helped with creating that haunting feeling that Oppenheimer constantly has. I was completely lost in thoughts when I walked out of the cinema, which is the best thing a movie can do. The days after the movie, I kept thinking about it."
10/10,These are the movies why i go to the cinema,07 2023,"Films like Oppenheimer are the reason to go to a cinema to enjoy a film to the maximum. Perhaps at the end of the year it will turn out that Oppenheimer will be the best film that 2023 has produced and if not it will definitely end up in the top 3. Do not expect a film with a lot of action, because Oppenheimer has become a biographical film with a lot of dialogues and political issues in it. They are Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. They impress in the film, but the rest of the cast also does an excellent job under the wing of Christopher Nolan. The soundtrack may not be as memorable as Tenet's or let alone Interstellar (of course Interstellar was made by Hans Zimmer), but all the elements are on board and the crackle of the Geiger counter under the music really adds power and gets completely under the skin. If you get the chance to visit the film in IMAX, it is absolutely recommended, but if there is no IMAX theater nearby, the regular silver screen will also suffice. In any case, Oppenheimer is a film that you should not miss in the cinema, because you will spend three hours watching this feat in amazement."
10/10,Great Educational Value,07 2023,"So much to learn about the science of the creation of those bombs! We have an amazing cast, doing things we need to learn about, so we can fully think them through. An eerie scene of the testing of the bomb shook through the whole room, but other than that, it did not live up to the hype that it should be seen on the big screen. Emily Blunt's character was nice to watch as the wife who had to part ways with her self to let the man do his work while she just sat around. On the other hand, there was one woman on the scientists team. Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show, as did Matt Damon."
8/10,Oppenheimer is one of the Most Complete Film from Nolan,07 2023,"The film is a study of the genius mind of Oppenheimer. The first third covers his character at a good speed, from his ways of being a womanizer to balancing it with his immersion into the Quantum Universe. The 2nd third of the movie focuses on him being onboarded into one of the world's costliest govt projects: The Manhattan Project overlooked by Leslie Groves played by Matt Damon. We see the successful testing of the bomb in the 2nd half along with the laying of the same in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
7/10,Good But Not Great,08 2023,"I am going to be honest and say that I am by no means a Christopher Nolan worshiper but was still pretty excited too see Oppenheimer. Interstellar and The Dark Knight are one of the best films I have ever seen in a theater so the bar was set pretty high. Fortunately, Oppenheimer mostly met my expectations. You definitely feel the runtime due to it being very dialoge heavy but I was never bored. The acting for the most part was great from every single actor but the script was pretty lackluster and the score which was haunting yet beautiful at times became way too intrusive during certain scenes. The movie did do a fantastic job at helping anyone unfamiliar with the dangers of atomic bombs understand that they can literally destroy the entire planet. My problem with Oppenheimer is that something felt like it was missing and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. Maybe it was the pacing which for a 3 hour long film was surprisingly way too fast. It is definitely very overhyped and nowhere near Nolan's best work, but overall I enjoyed it even though I won't be revisiting the film anytime soon."
9/10,Amazing,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" may be the greatest biopic I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan has struck gold again. The film is beautiful, terrifying, and leaves you thinking after the credits roll. The acting in this film is amazing. Cillian Murphy shines in the spotlight and deserves a nod at best actor, and Robert Downey jr. Puts on one of if not the greatest performance of his career. The practical effects are stunning, and brings to life the horror of an atomic bomb. The score is masterful portraying the right themes in the perfect moments. This film needs to be seen by everyone and on the biggest screen possible."
7/10,Where was all the physics?,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,"A fascinating, but also frustrating biopic, both thanks to Nolan's direction",09 2023,"By now, it is pretty obvious that Christopher Nolan's films have a very distinct style, similar themes and ideas, and epic, twisty narratives. He is an auteur for sure, but also one of the messiest ones, in my opinion. This story of Oppenheimer, so brilliantly and absorbingly portrayed on-screen by Nolan, is also frustrating at times because of his tendency to go back to his trademarks: twists, over-dramatization, and a complex time-jumping storyline. If you mix a standard biopic, with all of the elements of narrative of The Dark Knight, Interstellar, or Tenet, this is what you get. It's certainly not a bad thing, but at times just unnecessary."
9/10,Masterpiece!!,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. It stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, and explores his personal and professional life, his moral dilemmas, and his legacy."
8/10,The summer block buster!,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Oppenheimer stands out as one of the decade's most captivating films and serves as a reminder that cinema is an endeavor that requires hard work and perseverance.,07 2023,"This film is heavily dominated by dialogues. If you are a fan of action-packed films, you might find it boring. Although the film revolves around the topic of an atomic bomb, don't expect to see numerous explosions throughout the movie. Instead, it focuses not on the scientific formation of an atomic bomb, although there are some theories explained briefly, but on detailing the journey of Oppenheimer with his ideas, knowledge, strategies, and all the complexities he faced in creating the atomic bomb, which was ultimately used on Japan."
10/10,A monumental and engrossing achievement from Nolan,07 2023,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors operating today. He makes some of the most entertaining movies in modern cinema. Even at his worst, such as with his last film Tenet, it is still way more entertaining than a majority of movies released. After the Warner Bros same-day streaming debacle they pulled; Nolan left for Universal and this is his first film with them. Does Nolan continue to deliver or has he dropped a big bomb?"
10/10,Oppenheimer,07 2023,"For films like Oppenheimer, we fell in love with cinema, in short (Oppenheimer), which is the perfect meaning of the perfect, flawless, distinguished film, which Nola succeeded in presenting an exceptional biographical film. This movie is the greatest cinematic experience I've ever had. Nolan presented a historical and innovative masterpiece in terms of storytelling and ambiguity in a well-known true story. He presented the dialogues in an interesting and enthusiastic manner. The soundtrack was used in the film with the events in a great way. The sound effects are the best ever. As well as visual. Great acting performance by Murphy, Junior and the rest of the film's cast. The film has many of famous actors who were not disclosed in the film's trailer . Don't miss this movie. Thank you, Nolan and the rest of the crew."
6/10,Had potential; confusing and long.,07 2023,Character: 7/10 Story: 4/10 Plot: 5/10 Setting: 8/10 Execution: 6/10 Total: 30/50 (6 stars)
10/10,A Silent Masterpiece!,07 2023,This movie is a treat to eyes. Visuals are spectacular. Cinematography is top notch.
7/10,I finally understood Nolan films,07 2023,"I had anticipated a more straightforward, character-driven study of the man who helped to develop the atomic bomb, but instead, I was met with a 3-hour long summer blockbuster and a possibility of hearing loss."
2/10,Disappointing,07 2023,"I was expecting there to be more about the development of the bombs. One thing I was certain was going to be in the movie, for example, was not even mentioned: tickling the dragon's tail. That is the sort of content I was hoping for in this movie. If you are not familiar with this, do a search for Slotin, Daghlian, and tickling the dragon's tail. Essentially, what Slotin did was to carefully move two hemispheres of nuclear material ever so slightly closer together in an attempt to see what happens just before criticality. Oops! Yeah, major oops. I suppose these things weren't include because they actually happened after Hiroshima and Nagasaki by which time the movie was mostly over. That's fair, I guess. Still, that is the type of thing I was hoping for."
8/10,In depth and complex tense historical political drama of discovery and regret.,07 2023,"I watch most Christopher Nolan movies as they are long and in depth as he is a director that tries to state his case. His latest ""Oppenheimer"" is a well done look at a complex and important historical figure in scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer the developer who created and discovered the atomic bomb. The film is informative and it takes the viewer thru different time periods, while blending the life of a man with the current world. The cast and acting is all star form with Murphy who's great as Oppenheimer the chemistry is supported just fine by Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Florence Pugh. Along the way the scenes are tense as one can see that Oppenheimer has some regret and remorse after he created the bomb. It really takes one back to the days of the Cold War, communism, Hitler, and when Russia and Japan weren't friends of America. Over all any historical buff will enjoy this film as it leaves an impact just like Oppenheimer left impact."
10/10,Great movie,07 2023,"I found the movie difficult to follow at first. I've seen ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" and ""In The Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" so I knew pretty much the parameters of the story."
9/10,"The power of cinema, displayed by Nolan and Murphy",07 2023,"Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan returning to the absolute peak of his craft. You can say the same about Cillian Murphy, who delivers a performance that will hopefully be discussed or even studied in the years to come."
8/10,A great biographical spectacle,07 2023,"Finally, another Christopher Nolan film. I always look forward to going to the cinema and once again he didn't disappoint. After Tenet, which I thought was really hard to understand, this was a treat. Well made with good moments and made even better by the fact that it is history. I was sucked in right from the start as the various cuts that followed were nice and overall it grabbed me right from the start. I enjoyed every moment and waited until the explosion of course. That's what interested me the most. Again, I wasn't disappointed, but what mainly improved it was the audio. I was expecting a nice spectacle. I got that. I had pretty high expectations there, so it didn't wow me that much, but it appealed to me very positively with Ludwig Göransson's music, which always drew me into the story. At one point, he had me pretty well riveted with his music as well. I was a little worried about how it would turn out without Hans Zimmer, but it turned out that it wasn't only Tenet who had such a great soundtrack, at least in my opinion. I liked the music."
6/10,Doesn't deserve anything higher than an 7.5 on IMDB,07 2023,The movie was okay maybe decent. Are we really going to pretend that we were all at the edge of seats the whole time? I feel like the only people who are honestly rating this a 10 haven't ever pondered on their own the true implications of nuclear weapons and MAD. There was Nothing thought provoking about it. It was long and mostly boring. There's no reason not to wait and see it from home... Unless you want to see an 8 person meeting room on the big screen for an hour and half that is.
10/10,The moral conflict of the Oppenheimer,07 2023,Oppenheimer = 10/10
6/10,Way too long,09 2023,I'm giving this a six but only because the acting was so good. I fell asleep several times in the first hour but didn't feel liked I'd missed anything. The movie could have easily been one hour less. I will watch it again when it's available for home viewing. But I'll watch it in three stages. I have no doubt this movie will be up for a load of awards. The acting was amazing.
3/10,Whole movie feels like a trailer + documentary,08 2023,"The whole movie feels like a trailer. It's full of stitched up short hurried conversation sequences. Every single dialogue is ""important"" and ""witty"" and before you can even process it, they abruptly cut it and start the next scene. To add to the cognitive overhead, they switch back and forth between various time points. It's just very hard to keep up. It's more like a documentary than a movie and could have very well been a proper documentary, if they had thrown in some breathing space between scenes. If you go and watch it like a documentary, fully alert, prepared to take notes in your head, then this movie might be for you. But if that's what you want, why not just watch a BBC or DW documentary about the Manhattan project instead?"
10/10,A Masterpiece of Cinematic Brilliance - Oppenheimer (2023),07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that left me utterly spellbound from start to finish. Watching it in glorious 70mm was an experience like no other, immersing me into the stunning visuals that perfectly captured the essence of each scene. The use of color was masterful, enhancing the storytelling and evoking a range of emotions throughout the film."
8/10,Fatman Scoop,08 2023,"With the exception of ""Dunkirk"" that (not for any deliberate reason) I've not seen at all yet, I've seen every one of Christopher Nolan's films at the cinema since ""Memento"" at the start of the century. Whilst I appreciated aspects of ""Tenet"" it's fair to say that I didn't love it like I have some of the others and, whilst I again feel like I'm being kept at arm's length, I liked ""Oppenheimer"" more."
8/10,"Exceptional acting, with small shortcomings in cinematography and storytelling",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,It might be a perfect movie.,07 2023,"Oppenheimer was everything I wanted it to be and more. The three-hour run time is very warranted. Not only does it, not waste time. It shows you the realistic experiences of what the makers of the bomb and, most importantly, J Robert Oppenheimer went through making this. You don't have to like this movie if it's not your cup of tea, but if you say it is terrible, you are either straight-up stupid or insane. This is easily one of the best films of the year. If not the best, we will soon see, but I doubt it. This might not be my favorite Nolan film, but it might be his best and most Oscar-worthy. With a $100 million budget, this puts Disney to shame with all these effects being practical and something like Dial of Destiny being a lot of CGI. Please see the film, and you won't regret it."
9/10,Peak Nolan but what's with the sound?,07 2023,This is how to make a biopic of a complex historical figure without boring the audience! Oppenheimer is my most favourite Nolan's movie so far.
9/10,Historical psychodrama,07 2023,Oppenheimer was a horror drama that shows you how a humankind can destroy the world without thinking of its own kind.
8/10,Only one flaw,08 2023,"Let me start by saying that I've loved all Nolans movies so far and most of them I've seen many times. This one is another great one, and like the others, the acting is spot on. You can tell Murphy was the right man for the job. It also puts him up there with the very best. He's performance is just phenomenal and they use closups very effectively."
6/10,"Better watch ""Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran"" or ""Rocketry the Nambi Effect"" in IMAX",07 2023,"I have been a lover of Nolan's movies since my childhood and have developed feelings that ""whatever topic that he touches, converts into a gold"". He has proven that, be it Dunkirk, Batman Trio or even Tenet. But this time, he has done a weak job."
1/10,What is the point of creating this movie?,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,A very human film that is easily Nolan's best,09 2023,"I saw this film today in the cinema and I am just speechless. Before Oppenheimer, Interstellar was my favorite Christopher Nolan film. The music, the atmosphere, the ending where I almost cried - this makes Interstellar an ALMOST perfect masterpiece."
10/10,A Masterpiece,07 2023,"In my opinion, Oppenheimer is most likely the best movie we will watch in this decade. Everything about it is so beautifully handcrafted. To think this movie uses 0 cgi is mind blowing to me. The story is not boring at all; for three hours my eyes were stuck to the screen and not for a single moment I was tired or checked my phone. Oh yes, of course, if possible watch it on the biggest screen possible. But just please go watch the movie you will not be disappointed!"
8/10,A BOMB OF A FILM...?,08 2023,"Christopher Nolan's (Inception/The Prestige) latest about the man who invented the atomic bomb as played by Cillian Murphy (after playing the Scarecrow for him in his Batman trilogy). Unfolding in a non-linear timeline when Murphy is recruited by the military, personified by Oscar winner Matt Damon's general, to compose a team to work on the bomb, a presidential confirmation hearing for a cabinet position for a former military man, Oscar nominee, Robert Downey Jr., & a tribunal of sorts to confirm Murphy's security status which turns into a mock trial about his loyalties. W/Murphy in virtually every scene, we get a sense of what made the man tick as his thoughts were constantly on what he was engrossed by: the creation of a destructive force which he would ultimately regret bringing to fruition. W/a panoply of hot actors (too many to mention but it could make a good drinking game to take a shot when someone you recognize comes on screen), past Oscar winners & Nolan's penchant for making his sound design & score, composed by Ludwig Goransson, as much a character as the ones on screen (& which may fray some nerves for its constant presence), we may not have the pomp & circumstance one would expect for a film being hyped as an Imax experience (when the totality of the scenes in the film consists of people arguing in rooms) but the presentation is of such professional sheen, you'll forgive Nolan's obvious hucksterism in his final pitch."
9/10,"Christopher Nolan, ladies and gentlemen!",07 2023,"I had the privilege to watch it yesterday in an IMax theater and it was a wholesome experience. This movie ranks for me among Nolan's top 3 films and there is nothing anyone could do to change my mind. Nolan jumped in a completely new genre other than the adventure, action and sci fi genre and he outdid most of the biography films I have seen. I also hardly watch any political films and surprisingly the movie could grab my attention that much. From the very first scene till the last the cinematography and the great Ludwig Göransson's score will take your breath away and I think the oscar for best cinematography and score has already been decided. Ludwig's score in this film overtakes some of Hanz Zimmer's top scores that I admire. The VFX is no doubt so well made as well and you already know that he didn't use a single CGI shot. The movie resembles Cillian Murphy's top lifetime performance and I doubt anyone could have done Oppenheimer better than him and I doubt anyone could top his performance this year and it would be a complete robbery If he didn't get the oscar this year. More importantly, this movie represents a savior for RDJ's career. The first half his time on the screen wasn't much enough and I started to doubt that he would be great at all, however, the second half of the film was ompletely driven by him. He will take your breath away with one of his all-time best performance and I doubt that he would!t get at least an oscar nom for this. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh's time on the screen wasn't much and I actually didn't like Florence's character at all. Emily did a couple of great scenes within the time allowed for her, but still I actually felt this character a bit weird and her relationship and actions with Oppenheimer wasn't clear enough for me. The editing of this film was also one of the heros got all these elements together and of course all of that wouldn't haven been possible without the great mr. Christopher Nolan. He easily can transform any element and any actor to the best form he could ever imagine of himself. All in all, it's a cinematic meal that you wouldn't wanna miss and the I-Max experience was one of a kind. A solid 9/10 and one of Nolan's all time top films."
10/10,Openheimer - A Mind-Bending Masterpiece,07 2023,"""Openheimer,"" the much-anticipated cinematic collaboration between visionary director Christopher Nolan and the incredibly talented actor Cillian Murphy, is an intellectually stimulating and visually captivating journey into the life and mind of one of the most enigmatic figures in history, J. Robert Oppenheimer. With this biographical drama, Nolan once again proves his prowess in delivering mind-bending narratives, while Murphy's performance shines as he fully embodies the complex character of Oppenheimer."
9/10,Excellent but Shallow,09 2023,"OPPENHEIMER is compelling from start to finish. The performances range from excellent to outstanding. The look of the film is amazing. For all its accomplishments, it does not shed much new light on J. Robert Oppenheimer. Instead, Lewis Strauss emerges as the more interesting figure, but the film is not titled STRAUSS."
9/10,A Tour-De-Force for Cillian Murphy in the lead. In the end what it truly accomplishes is opening our eyes,08 2023,"Ok I wanted to quickly review Oppenheimer while its still fresh in my mind. So much to discuss. Firstly the cast, WOW! I love all the actors I found here, at least one of each of their movies is something I've really enjoyed in the past. Really like Josh Hartnett thrown in, Matthew Modine as well. Especially good cast for movie trivia in relation to past movies and collaborations. Each one contributes a significant role whether brief or not to the story of ""The Father Of the Atomic Bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer. But enough about that, let me dissect this movie a bit and offer some quick hits."
7/10,"Amazing cast, two serious flaws",07 2023,"The acting in this film is fascinating and the cast is absolutely stellar. It's an interesting story and certainly would have deserved a 9 were it not for two major flaws that are common in movies these days but taken to absurd excess here. First, the sound. It was so muffled and echoey, and the music and sound effects were so overwhelming, that my friends and I missed at least a third of the dialog. Since the drama depended on the dialog, this was a serious error in judgment. At times, it was obvious something very humorous was occurring in the dialog, but the entire audience just sat in confused silence trying to figure out what was going on. And then there were the frequent changes in scene. Just as you are settling into a scene, suddenly the story jumps to a different city, with different people, in a different decade. Between the inaudible dialog and the frenetic changes in scene, the film was often difficult to follow. I look forward to watching this with subtitles to see what I missed."
4/10,"Good acting, poor storytelling",08 2023,Saw this movie today and I must say it is incredibly long and BORING.

10/10,Best movie I ever seen in my entire life.,07 2023,"I wanted to watch this on the release day, but my brother wanted to watch it with me and he said he will take some time. So, my friend saw it on the release day and told me it's the worst movie he ever saw, but I knew better than to believe him, and said that he might not have understood the movie since this is the first movie of Nolan he watches."
8/10,"Compelling, but lacks substance. A movie for the TikTok generation.",07 2023,"The first hour of the movie screams ""afraid of losing my audience"". At points it's almost like a trailer, with random lines thrown one after the other. It gets better from the bomb test onward, then the last half an hour is completely unnecessary, just like the entire character of Downey Jr, despite his great acting."
6/10,Worst Nolan movie!,07 2023,"""Worst Nolan movie! It's worth watching, but I'm not sure if it's worth the ticket. The story isn't bad because it's a true story; in fact, if you watch 'Fat Man and Little Boy,' you get the same story (albeit with fewer details), and it's a good story, even though the film is old and follows a linear structure. However, compared to Nolan's own films like 'Memento,' the structure of 'Oppenheimer' is indeed weak. 'Memento' is one of the best films in the history of cinema with that kind of structure. Also, you can take movies with a much simpler story that could be told in a short time, like David Finch's 'The Social Network,' which uses the same type of structure and works very well because it has the right amount of cuts and flashbacks. The film is already long, and so many flashbacks for a story like this made the movie tedious. Could see lots of people on their phones after 2h into the movie."
10/10,Masterpiece,07 2023,"I walked into this movie with the expectation of it being anywhere from a top 5 Chris Nolan film to a Top 5 film of all time. Seeing it in IMAX, witnessing, feeling and experiencing the film in full force. I can honestly say it's closer to the ladder than the former for me. Am I saying it's 100% a top 5 film of all time? No necessarily but I think it's of the cloth of all those films like the Godfather, 2001, Shawshank ect. I think this is the best Nolan film, I think he truly made his magnum opus here and I can't wait to see if and or when he trys to top this. This is also probably the best true story I've ever seen adapted. Cillian was oscar worthy and should receive best actor for how his eyes carried so much weight in this film. Watch this film and my review on deep thought productions on YouTube. Thanks."
7/10,Uncertainty is the principle,07 2023,"As auteurs so often must do, whether by choice or by some deep sense of selfishness, they must decide which three hours, out of so many more, to create from a source material that could be combined or split into discrete parts, maybe eventually a miniseries or podcast. As Julius Caesar once wrote, as the victor of the Gallic Wars, all of Gaul is divided into three parts. I have no doubt that Caesar struggled to decide which to write about most, and with what spin."
2/10,"Bloated, artless - big disappointment",08 2023,"I left the theater with three terms bouncing around my head: overwrought, unfocused and self-indulgent. A few good moments were not enough to redeem it from being mediocre at best, totally artless at worst. The special effects were disappointing, the runtime was bloated, and the central character conflict was sidelined by a political plot so tedious, words fail me in further elaboration."
10/10,brilliant,07 2023,"One of the best nolan's films ever. It's not just about the powerful message the movie itself has but also the movie is so well done, smart, clever, holistic, is not enough to say."
10/10,I Think its the best movie I've seen in the last decade,07 2023,"The second best movie from christopher nolan, but if you an action boy please dont watch it this movie is a masterpiece and it dosent contain the action you want. Cillian Murphy that's one of the best performance i've ever seen and everyone watched the film will confirm this ."
10/10,Fantastic!,07 2023,TLDR: this is what Hollywood has needed for a long time!
10/10,Oscar blockbuster IMAX film.,07 2023,"Definitely an Oscar winning movie, Nolan as usual challenging himself beyond the limit of CGI and creating amazing locations. All actors did tremendous performances especially Cillian. Cillian perseverance in every character & role makes him really deserving of winning an Oscar. It's not a typical biography movie you'd expect but it's full of science and physics which Nolan clearly loves. And then comes the movie score it was on point in every scene escalating to the movie theme music. Knowing that it's a 3h movie it's not easy to keep you involved in the movie the whole time but Nolan did & and he did it brilliantly."
8/10,You can't lift the stone without being ready for the snake that's revealed,08 2023,"The release of ""Oppenheimer"" was preceded by a lot of publicity. Despite this the film was not on my list for a long time. After a few small movies (""Following"" (1998), ""Memento"" (2000) and ""Insomnia"" (2002)) director Christopher Nolan got access to bigger budgets. Beginning with ""Batman begins"" (2005) his films became epic productions in the action and / or science fiction genre. In my opinion David Lean did a better job in the transition from small fllms to big budget productions than did Christopher Nolan. After the release however I red some very positive reviews and ""Oppenheimer"" still came on my watchlist."
10/10,Literal boom!,07 2023,"My first 10! During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history."
7/10,"Restrained, wordy, and thoughtful if loud",07 2023,Great news: there are none of the usually-mandatory cliche deep-penetration synth bass drum booms banging out the backing track in feeble attempt at punctuating excitement here.
9/10,Goes with a bang and not a whimper,08 2023,"That Christopher Nolan really has delivered some astonishing films: ""Dunkirk"", ""Tenet"", ""Interstellar"" and so on. He really hasn't put out a dud yet despite pushing all sorts of boundaries and working with some mind-bending scripts. Maybe I'm just a sucker for this type of filmmaking but either way I had high hopes for ""Oppenheimer"" and I wasn't disappointed."
5/10,"OK, but not a Classic",08 2023,Plusses
9/10,Rawboned,08 2023,The lead actor Mr Murphy was nearly as gaunt as the real Robert Oppenheimer. A similarity to Shawshank Redemption where the lead was born for the part. In Shawshank Tim Robbins excells and goes on to appear in not much. C. Murphy is unique and perhaps limited in future centre stage roles. My pick for the movies stand out is Robert Downey Jnr. He entertained us with his broad spectrum of thespian skills. This time a real snake in the grass. The authentic RDj was just under the surface busting to free range. Jason Clarke the Australian actor put in a subpurb performance as the hawkish prosecutor. Director Christopher Nolan is to the directors fraternity what Daniel Day Lewis is to the thespian club. A massive hands on effort. Gripping. The movie is looo...ng with little crash bang action. It's take up in many Asian countries/ communities would be limited. The ultimate dialogue spectacle. A thinking platform deluxe.
8/10,Terrific film on terrific fact,08 2023,"Nolan once again is superior , although this is a film with star-studded people, which originally I don't like gathering so much incredible actors in one film, and I think that degrades the movie but not on this one. There are some turns that are not necessary. But not so much that it will take away the value of the film although it's a three hours movie I was never bored. It's captivate me whenever I feel lost. The timeline is a bit fuzzy but usually you will pick up the pace at the end, what I didn't understand is that is he a good person or a bad person did he ever regret what he did? Is it a film that polishes his picture or just state the villain that he is, I think it was very neutral. Wish is obviously a basic rule when dealing with people that are portrayed in films."
10/10,Involving and epic,07 2023,"I was afraid that 3h would be too long, I was wrong. The movie captured my attention from beginning to the end. The whole film making turned the experience involving and epic."
8/10,Excellent film but could have done more,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Riveting,08 2023,"It's quite an accomplishment to take complicated historical events, make them compelling and entertaining, as well as artistic. Ron Howard did it with ""Apollo 13"", Steven Spielberg with ""Saving Private Ryan"", and Christopher Nolan has done it with ""Oppenheimer"". Even if you have read the book on which this motion picture is based and have a knowledge of history, this movie will be enlightening and thought-provoking. In addition, the performances by an amazing cast (Cillian Murphy's first starring role, now certainty not his last), remarkable direction and cinematography make this the must-see feature of 2023."
6/10,A potentially good drama ruined by a catastrophic edit,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
6/10,Will never watch this again! Why?,07 2023,Two reasons I will never watch this again:
5/10,Totally shocked... This film will put some people to sleep... seriously!,07 2023,I am a HUGE Nolan fan. I love his films so you can imagine my excitement to have seen press reviews and booked to see this movie. I avoided trailers cos I wanted to be blown away.
9/10,Phenomenal,07 2023,"Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the story centers around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) who was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr (Matt Damon) during a pivotal time in World War II. They gather a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. The aftermath of his creation not just changed the world but also turned his personal life upside down."
10/10,You should watch it!!!!!,07 2023,One of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life.
8/10,Nolan At The Peak Of His Talents,09 2023,"The positives? The cinematography is outstanding, the performances are all impressive and the ultimate story is well crafted. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Will deservedly receive Oscar nominations. I watched it in IMAX and although I'm glad I did, the use of oppressive sounds to communicate gravity and ominous portent felt overdone."
10/10,The best really the best,07 2023,"The combination of Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Ludwig Gorranson without any doubt leads to the very best, which it did. Amazing, excellent, best qualities if every element in cinema. A movie made by a genius. The music is so good, other gorransin's works i had heard were book of boba fett and mandalorian, unique . This one also is really excellent. It was great seeing cillian on big screen after peaky blinders. As usual, at his best. Mat damon and robert downey were amazing. Emily blunt. They really worked as a team and created this memory long lasting movie . Bravo, i really enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone."
10/10,Masterpiece ... Higher than any rating,07 2023,"It is difficult to explain my feeling after watching the movie, especially in an IMAX experience ... The Cinematography is incredible and the acting is beyond the professional from all the actors and actresses, as if you went back in time to watch the events... In every moment of the movie there is a story of creativity ... I have watched dozens of documentaries from the period of World War II, and several of them were about the nuclear bomb and Oppenheimer, but this film was more than excellent at delivering events with all suspense and without any complicated dialogues.... A wonderful cinematic work that we will always remember, and as history remembered Oppenheimer and his apex addition to humanity.... The film carries a valuable message to everyone who watches it and adds to the world of cinema a lot of genius and beauty... It is rare for me to give a rating of 10 to a movie in my life. Perhaps I gave a rating of 10 to 5 movies in my life, and this is the sixth of them... With all happiness, I am proud that I lived in the time when I was able to attend this movie in the cinema on the firt day .... And perhaps I will watch it more than once without getting bored ... Thanks to everyone who worked on producing this masterpiece, and thank you ... Thank you Oppenheimer for all you have done for humanity ."
6/10,good movie with some issues,08 2023,"Let's get this straight form the start I'm not saying this is a bad movie, I'm saying it is a good movies with some issues. I know Christopher Nolan is the last director in Hollywood who gets a big budget to make original movies, but that doesn't make them automatically great."
9/10,A heartfelt story of the first developed WMD,07 2023,This movie was a great one directed by someone who in my opinion is one of the best directors of our time. The story was very well timed and payed out with the development of all of the characters and their relationships with each other.
6/10,Underwhelmingly Lacking in Nolanism,09 2023,"This movie failed to captivate me, although it has potential. Nolan was able to justify the long run time, I don't think the movie is stuffed with fillers or unnecessary scenes. The story is rich and it has historical significance. If anything I can easily imagine a miniseries that goes into even more depth, exploring more of the many characters' background or delving into the science more. The pace also was fairly tolerable, I didn't particularly feel bored. I think the main problem, however, is that the movie feels bland. All this buildup, but in the end the climax felt weirdly lacking."
2/10,Practically the most overhyped film of the century,09 2023,"I wonder if all those who are dropping a 9-10 rating after another have all watched the chaos of a movie I did, or they have financial interest on rating the movie positively."
10/10,Cillian Murphy 11/10,07 2023,"Masterpiece. Movie is aboslute masterpiece. Cillian perfomances are stunning. In some parts of movie my heart was beating like it was Oppenheimer myself. That is because Cillian is masterclass actor. Movie is like a fine book or some badass fine wine, 3 hours of this movie fly by like it was 3 seconds. I think that if people is giving less than 10, they are just shittie idots, don't appreciate this movie or they don't have enough knowledge, experience or taste to see when movie is masterpiece. I think the messege is clear with this movie. How rutless world can be, when you are needed country will lick your balls, but once you are not gonna listen orders or having your own opinon. They will eat you alive. So also is with a friends or coworkers because of their own ego and jelousy they will do everthing to see your failure.😄"

I am now twice as terrified of thermonuclear war than I was when I went in, and my cynicism got a dose of adrenaline but boy, was it worth it."

9/10,The Best Film of the Year,07 2023,Oppenheimer is an incredibly thrilling biopic following the father of the atomic bomb.
9/10,Fast paced with suspense,08 2023,"Oppenheimer is a fantastic movie that keeps you alert in suspense from the start to the very end. Great cast, great story lines, great setting and nicely shot. It is about the making of the bom that will end world war 2 and the effects it had on the world and personally on the maker, oppenheimer."
9/10,One of Nolan's best and perhaps his most personal & important film,07 2023,This might be Christopher Nolan's most personal movie yet and it's absolutely brilliant.
7/10,I feel tricked...,07 2023,"The movie is good but all that noise about seeing it on the biggest screen possible (I did) is unfounded. It's a procedural and you can see it on any screen you want. I was more impressed with the sound than the visuals. FX are secondary and spare, while the framing of individual shots is rather standard and the cuts so quick as too make it practically inconsequential anyway. It's still worth seeing in a movie theater, and it is a good film with some stellar performances. It's almost a shame there are so many name actors in it because it snaps you out of the story when you keep recognizing people in what amounts mostly to bit parts. It's not Nolan's best but it is a decent drama."
10/10,Mesmerizing Masterpiece By Mr. Nolan: Take A Bow Sir 🙏🙏,07 2023,Mr Nolan at his best. Just WoW.
6/10,"Good, not great.",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
2/10,Terrible disappointment,08 2023,"Despite struggling with a very interesting ethical issue (scientist's responsibility for their creations), this unnecessarily long film is as simplistic and plain as any early James Bond movie or something of the kind. At certain point, the main villain even reveals his evil plan just like in a bad action film. No characters change as the story progresses, so that it becomes boring to watch them talk dry lines. The story does not have double layers, nor ambiguous interpretations: it's like a Wikipedia entry."
9/10,Christopher Nolan is in a league of his own.,07 2023,"The only thing keeping this movie from a perfect 10 for me is just personal taste. I'll always prefer a Nolan original story than an adapted true story. With that being said, Nolan made this movie as engaging and thrilling as any biographical movie could possibly be. Every element of this film is just top notch filmmaking. I can't really imagine any other movie releasing this year coming close to it, and I expect it to near sweep come award season."
9/10,Masterpiece Indeed,07 2023,There's no need to exaggerate the brilliance of cinematography in Oppenheimer. The casting and the music indeed is top notch. The knowledge of basic atomic physics will make a huge difference to the viewers' relatability to the plot. Also the fact that Nolan has tried to elevate the humanitarian aspect of Oppenheimer using the metaphor of Promethius is absolutely brilliant.
10/10,A Subtle Masterpiece,07 2023,"In Christopher Nolan's 2023 film 'Oppenheimer', audiences are treated to a masterful cinematic experience that delves into the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb.' The film is a meticulously crafted biographical drama that explores the complexities of Oppenheimer's character and the moral dilemmas faced during the creation of the world's most destructive weapon."

7/10,Lots of Hype... But a Good Movie,07 2023,"Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies - Movie Review (7/29/23): ""Oppenheimer"""
1/10,Boring war propaganda,07 2023,"Strike one: This movie is just a boring mess! Three hours of middle aged men in brown clothes talking, and talking, and talking - just barely audible above the irritating soundtrack."
10/10,Best Film of the Year,08 2023,"J. Robert Oppenheimer is an extraordinary and famous figure who led the controversial ""Manhattan Project"" and this time he is shown so boldly in a biopic. Based on the 2005 biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer is a testament to hard work, dedication and consistency. With more epic and historical scale than his previous works, Christopher Nolan presents cinematic perfection in terms of directing, screenwriting, visual effects, cinematography, casting, and music scoring. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a career-defining performance in this 3-hour film that is sure to be reckoned with in this year's film award competition. It's easy to call Oppenheimer the best film of the year, but more important is the proof that the only one who can beat Christopher Nolan is himself."
8/10,"7,5/10",08 2023,"I found the movie very disturbing. Oppenheimer is very enthusiastic about the development of the atomic bomb. It's obvious what can be done with this bomb. But it's not until much later that he realizes the horror of what he's doing. After he learns that children are dying! How convincing. I watched in horror as people applauded wildly when they learned about the devastation caused to the civilian population by the bombs dropped on Japan. I hope these images are just from an ordinary scenario. Murphy's acting is superb. I'll be surprised if he doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. I was horrified to watch this attack on the civilian population, which was not guilty of any crime in the history of the world, in the cinema. Not a movie for the summer months. I don't think it's Nolan's best movie either. But if you have an extra three hours, you can watch it."
10/10,Absolutely masterpiece,07 2023,Interstellar was the first movie I saw of Nolan and since then I fell in love with his work and watched his every movie. I was waiting for Oppenheimer since 8-9 months and I was not disappointed the movie was worth every penny the cinematics and the amazing sound quality will make you fall in love with Nolan again and the way he tells the story is truly amazing. This a movie which deserves to be seen only in cinemas the small screen will not to justice to this masterpiece. After the interval the movie becomes so interesting that you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat. I can't wait for Nolan's next movie now and I wish he makes thousand more movies.
8/10,"Great movie, won't see it again",07 2023,"I saw Oppenheimer tonight, July 21, 2023 with my two adult children. We all enjoyed the movie very much, and the story was wonderfully told and beautifully shot. There were excellent performances by Cillian Murphy, as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Downey, Jr., as Lewis Strauss, and Emily blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, and a tremendous and talented supporting cast as well."
8/10,"Nolan manages to convey the story about the atomic bomb in an interesting, understandable way without special effects.",07 2023,"Oppenheimer is a new film adaptation of a historical biography directed, co-written and produced by Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk."
7/10,A Riveting Tale with Room for Improvement,08 2023,"While I was initially disappointed by 'Oppenheimer's' departure from Nolan's signature fantasy time-travel themes, it's still a great movie."
4/10,Long and underwhelming,08 2023,The movie was different from what I expected. I thought there was be more focus on the Manhattan project and Oppenheimer's role and less on Oppenheimer's personal and political life. It turns out the movie is almost exclusively about Oppenheimer's personal and political life.
9/10,"An Important Movie With Striking Visuals, Amazing Performances and An Unfortunately Prescient Moral of a Story",07 2023,"Oppenheimer is an unconventional movie for this time of year. It's not action heavy flick and it's mostly reliant on dialogue and conversation between the characters. My favourite part of Oppenheimer is that the story, characters and events were riveting despite the fact I knew comparatively little about the Manhattan Project going into the theatre. I was enraptured by these backroom political machinations and long conversations in classrooms, everything felt pertinent to the story and despite the contemplative pace, I couldn't turn away. If you're worried that some elements of Oppenheimer may go over your head, it shouldn't deter you from going to see it. I certainly didn't catch everything but when taken into context with the gravity of the stakes, the movie was no less entertaining or involving for it."
10/10,A Masterpiece,07 2023,"Without the doubt, one of the biggest masterpieces of our time. Taking such a sensitive story, and tell it the best way possible. That's signature Christopher Nolan. Needless to say Cillian Murphy was incredibly convincing and accurate. Definitely deserves an Oscar! It is so hard to make a story that is based on historical facts, this interesting. Whole movie keeps you on the edge. Build up is phenomenal, waiting for July 16th 1945 and when it happens, it all make sense. Timeline is not linear and in my opinion this makes the story even more alluring as it leads the audience to think ""why does he feel the way he feels in the future"". Now I've become death, destroyer of worlds!"
10/10,The Best Biopic ever.,07 2023,"It is a Nolan movie. It is a biopic. It is about the life of the most important man in the world at that time. His complexities, his flaws, his challenges and how he was treated. Those aspects cannot be changed by Nolan. It is based on a book. But Nolan takes the source material adds his flavor of intertwined timeline, epic visuals, brilliant dialogues (the best in any Nolan movie), mind-blowing sound and a fantastic screenplay."
10/10,Arguably the best movie of the year,07 2023,"In a year that saw the release of movies like John Wick and Mission Impossible, Oppenheimer stands out as a shining gem. Throughout its 3 hour duration, I found myself literally on the edge of my seat, immersed in a well-crafted storyline and a stellar cast."
10/10,"Oppenheimer (2023, Christopher Nolan) Nolan, master of his craft, brings a pivotal point in history to life with a stellar lineup of acting talent",08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,"Wonderful, but maybe not a movie",08 2023,"Nolan's newest film is both well-acted and well shot. I believe those are the movie's best aspects so I'll get to why I don't think it stands out among his best films. Though there is nothing wrong with dialogue carrying the plot, film is still meant to be a visual medium. When I found out that this film was based on a book, ""American Prometheus"", I was not shocked. This film just went too far with the dialogue and I feel like they didn't have to add every element from the novel into this movie. It just made it too long and too hard to follow. Again, well-acted with a fantastic cast and the social and political commentary was brilliant, but I felt it went too far with the back-and-forth between characters."
7/10,Sloppy and distracting close up shots,08 2023,"Acting was fabulous. Choice of film stock and the way it was filmed also. But (and this is quite a big but), a lot of the scenes were out of focus. Especially the IMAX 70mm shots. It was so distracting to a point that I went looking for focus points (oh look, the ear is in focus). I know Nolan doesn't 're-shoot' but it felt sloppy work."
9/10,One ticket to OPPENHEIMER please!,07 2023,"Oppenheimer was one of my most anticipated movies of the year! Why? It's directed by my favorite director ever: Christopher Nolan. He has never made a bad movie, makes consistently good movies, and gives the audience original and unique films for their jaw to drop! I love this movie! It's very dialogue heavy, well paced, beautifully shot, amazing music score, Oscar worthy acting, and a fantastic script! This film will definitely get nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I hope it wins a lot of them! Cillian Murphy is absolutely stupendous! This is his best performance to date as I do see an Oscar nomination coming his way. Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Are also excellent as I also see nominations coming their way! This film would not have been as great if not for the performances because basically everyone gives a performance to not be forgotten! Nolan breaks down this film into three different acts which work so well. The story structure is very smooth although it can be hard to follow during the last act. I was invested from start to end and I was really surprised with how well the dialogue was written! It didn't disappoint as it's my current MOVIE OF THE YEAR!"
6/10,Expected so much More,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
1/10,missed a big occasion,09 2023,"Nolan missed a big occasion to talk about scientific approach to the event of that historical period. He describes a character involved in his personal limits in which the making of the bomb is just an excuse for portrait sexual behavior, intrigues, duels, betrayals.... and so on. The movie talks about Oppenhaier but doesn't face the scientific study that led to the realization of the bomb. Dialogues are often uselessly emphasized in constant search for the pace. So, relationship, dialogues, scenes seem full of exaggerations at the expense of the scientific argument. Some actors seem don't fit the character.... look at Matt Damon interpretation. He looks too much rigid in many scenes."
10/10,Once in a decade Masterpiece!,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,"Oppenheimer, a unforgettable movie .",07 2023,"Saw the movie "" OPPENHEIMER "" at PVR Phoenix( Parel) on the first day second show of its release in India on Friday(22/7/2023). As a student of history found the movie true to its era of "" World War II "" but was also surprized regarding the bold sex scenes in the film. Definitely a bit censured to Indian audiences. The film was extraordinary in special effects while depicting the testing of the first atomic bomb and subtle in not showing the dropping of the 2 atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Having visited Zurich was amazed to see the Grossmünster church towers depicted in the initial introduction of the film. Excellent movie but could be boring for non history buffs. A Oscar contender and if a film addict don't miss this film even if physics is not your pet subject of discussion."
9/10,Incredible storytelling,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,A Magnificent Piece of Cinema,07 2023,"Oppenheimer has left a profound impact on me. The film's storytelling and character study were brilliantly executed, drawing me into the life and mind of J Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of exceptional, bringing depth and authenticity to the character."
10/10,Captivating and Brilliant,08 2023,"As a science/engineering student, I couldn't have hoped for a more captivating topic. As a cinephile, this film offers an opportunity to appreciate every facet of filmmaking. By focusing on intricate details, the narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat. What you assemble during the viewing is sufficient to hold your attention to the action, and the pieces you'll connect afterwards will compel you to revisit it."
9/10,WOW,07 2023,"I'm not gonna lie and say I was 100% excited for Oppenheimer because I wasn't at first, I remember seeing the trailer in the cinema and thinking ""yeah I'm gonna watch that one day"" anyway the whole Barbenheimer thing happened and my hype grew for the film (more for Barbie if I'm being honest) but I just left the cinema and wow."
6/10,"I could have given this movie an 8 out of 10, but it had problems ...",07 2023,"The first two hours were disjointed and annoying at times ... rapid and awkward scene changes, unrelated cuts to different story threads that had no sense of connection or relevance at times. There were story elements in the first half that could have easily been left out, there was no need to make this movie 3 hours long. It should have been about quality, not quantity. However with all that said, the last hour of this movie rescued what could have been a disaster. It was brilliant, dramatic and intense, Nolan at his best in my opinion. It left me feeling that it had been a worthwhile movie-going experience despite the lack of coherence in the first two hours."

7/10,Boring old news trapped in the past,07 2023,"I used to have respect for Nolan before I realized he doesn't embrace the change of times. It' very simple. You either embrace great changes, grow, and become better or you just become old news trapped in the past. And this is the case with Nolan."
3/10,"Great actors, bad storytelling, badly dramatized scenes",07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,Not for all people,07 2023,"I understand that many people were disappointed by the film because they were waiting a movie about the ww2 or the making of the atomic bomb, from the name of the movie you knows that its not, it about the story of oppenheimer. A little boring and a little too long and some time make so confused by the many names and informations that were thrown in some scenes, but it's intentional by nolan, he wants you to stay focus and enjoy the dialogue which you should if you are a true cinema lover. A masterpiece in every single way from music to cinematography to story telling.... Not the best film in the history that's for sure but it is indeed the most important story in the history of mankind."
10/10,A masterpiece of cinema,08 2023,"A masterpiece of cinema, Christopher Nolan delivered with genuine sincerity and vigour."
9/10,Prometheus's God but Oppenheimer was a human,08 2023,"Director Nolan's directing is touching. The plot, the script, the directing, and the aesthetic parts were all beautiful. The directing of Oppenheimer's anguish and chain reaction in particular shows once again that Nolan is a genius director."
10/10,One of the most Cinematic film ever!,09 2023,OPPENHEIMER 2023 'Oppenheimer' is Christopher Nolan's best film since 'The Dark Knight'. In some ways these two films are his best work ever!
6/10,Tiw Oppenheimer,07 2023,Today I watched Nolan's Oppenheimer and it was good.
8/10,"Great film, but didn't feel as devastated as I thought I should",07 2023,"First off, some absolutely stand out performances. The ensemble cast was excellent. Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon were excellent (I am absolutely here for post action hero Damon!). The score is also beautiful."
2/10,Poor biography. Not wort watching. Much hyped,07 2023,"Oppenheimer is 80% of interrogation between opphenhimer and Lewis Strauss assembled people to check opphenhimer loyalty to America. It's 10% of Trinity test and 10% some glims of Manhattan project. So it's a crap out of it. Don't watch it in theater , wait and watch in ott. Oppenheimer is much hyped crap. Even though the subject in public domain Nolan not delevared a good script. It's another fail movie from him."
10/10,Nolan has done it again!,07 2023,"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, is a thought-provoking cinematic journey that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a stellar cast and exceptional storytelling, Nolan's ambitious project offers audiences an insightful look into the mind of a genius torn between moral obligations and the relentless pursuit of scientific discovery."
10/10,This film is a masterpiece of cinematic art.,08 2023,"This is a great work of cinema. The through line is the walking on the sides of the moral line that Nolan projects in the film. What one needs to know before going to see this film is born in the title. This film is about the internal anguish, at times, Oppy, himself is not sure of. It's about a man who has the power but waivers about his conviction of the exertion of that power. This is a power he believes he must exert. His power is like Sophie's Choice. He has to choose one or the other and either decision provides both good and evil outcomes. There are winners and losers. Humanity wins and loses at the same time. I think writer/producer/director Nolan puts this across very succinctly. Technically the audio visual choices are superior. The sound editing and score gives you the feeling of a snowball rolling down a hill. It doesn't let up. Just goes faster and gets larger as it keeps going Down."
10/10,Prometheus' Curse,08 2023,"Nothing but a masterpiece here, Nolan's movie about Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, is way more than just one of those stale biopics in Hollywood History. It's visually breathtaking, with great cinematography, editing and soundtrack, set design and a monumental cast of perfect performances by dozens of the best actresses and actors working flawlessly for this historical epic, which should find it's place in film history forever."
10/10,One of the best movie experiences of my life,07 2023,"In simple words, Christopher Nolan is THE GOAT... Oppenheimer reaffirms it again. With each film in his filmography, he has established himself as one of the best directors in the industry. Each new work surpasses its predecessor. This film is the synthesis of what Nolan is himself, cinema."
8/10,Needs a 2nd viewing...,08 2023,"Big fan and highly recommend the TV series ""Manhattan"". Didn't think I had much left to learn. However, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly illustrates how rapidly the world of physics changed in the 30's and the urgency with which the, largely Jewish, group of scientists leapt into action to kick some Nazi ass. The pen is mightier...with the caveat, Gen. Groves also kind of a badass to make it all happen. Not a ten because I'm thick and had trouble following the story line involving Strauss/Oppy conflict. (the isotope story? I needed more info) Even though the Editor will get Oscar nom., Even though using B&W is a cue, I felt like I was playing catch up in all the Downey scenes. No fault of R. D.'s, he was pitch perfect. As was Murphy, Blunt and Damon. Assassins all. In a good way, this movie is very dense. I'm not a fan of having to watch something more than once to completely absorb the story. The naturalistic, quick, sometimes muffled dialogue, took a minute to get used to. But once I let go and assumed I was in good hands it got better. The three hours flies by. I saw the 70mm print, yes it's worth the extra bread. I wept for mankind after the ""successful"" test. So, mission accomplished there Christopher. Again, great flick, not a ten because I have to see it again."
10/10,Possibly the best film I have ever seen,07 2023,"Have been here for quite some time (over 50 years) and have watched my share of very good films, but this might very well take the cake."
9/10,A memorable biography of a determined and intelligent yet ultimately naive nuclear physicist,08 2023,"The story is told from Oppenheimer's perspective and focuses on key moments from his life and his relationships with those closest to him, making it a biographical account of events. The narrative alternates between a trial in the late 1950s and the development of the atomic (fission) bomb between 1942-45. Nolan uses color when presenting events from Oppenheimer's own perspective, but switches to black & white when recounting them from the perspective of others. He portrays the physicist's mental illness through occasional glimpses of his dreams (or nightmares) and visions."
3/10,Not sure why 70MM IMAX was needed for this slugfest?,07 2023,Let's start with the positives:
9/10,CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
10/10,A drama made like an action movie,07 2023,Warning: Spoilers
9/10,Christopher Nolan made magic,08 2023,Warning: Spoilers
8/10,Informative,08 2023,"Yes.... it was a long movie, 3 hours! But very informative and based on true story. I was glad to learn so much detail of an important history. Very well written script and great acting. So many emotional scenes and the casts really portrait these characters perfectly."
7/10,Well crafted and intriguing peak into history,07 2023,A very well crafted and intriguing look into the man who changed the world forever but it's not for everybody...
7/10,"Too long, generic biopic",07 2023,"There is nothing to write home about this one. Sure, the acting is decent and the photography is ok, but that is a standard for any solid movie. It is hard to make a masterpiece when you have predefined limits of a biopic genre. Directors usually don't have enough creative freedom to really push the limits. Maybe it's just me but I don't find the story or protagonists very compelling. I actually love science but this was already familiar matter to me. Also, it feels too long and the narative is a nothing new, present day actions interweaved with flashbacks from the past. If I would want to watch a biopic I would rather choose a movie like Aviator, Air or something similar."
