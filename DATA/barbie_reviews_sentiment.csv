6/10,"Beautiful film, but so preachy",07 2023,"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,"As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.",07 2023,"As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,07 2023,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Well this really did come as a surprise.,07 2023,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie!,07 2023,"8.5/10 While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Strong Start... and That's It,07 2023,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,OVERHYPED,08 2023,"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
3/10,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,08 2023,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Ken out of ten,07 2023,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Not what I Expected,08 2023,"I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun,08 2023,"For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,The best version of itself,07 2023,"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.",POSITIVE,1,0
4/10,"Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one",07 2023,"I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,I don't see how it was preachy,08 2023,"In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Good...not great,07 2023,"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,not for everyone,07 2023,"This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me? I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,No Direction,07 2023,"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
4/10,Preacher Barbie?,08 2023,"I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end. By the time they were talking about ordinary Barbie, all I could think was ""Sanctimonious Barbie.""",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,"It's like G.I Joe...For girls! Seriously, and I love it for that!",07 2023,"I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,serious Barbie,07 2023,"BARBIE (2023) Greetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,"A trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes",08 2023,"The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Kenough,09 2023,"Movies are odd sometimes. In this case, I feel like the review I would have written the second the credits rolled would've been more positive than the one I'm watching now, a couple of hours later. But, as I've had time to sit with this one, I can't help but feel my opinion on it... Diminishing.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,What A Film! I Was Ecstatic About Seeing Barbie And It Definitely Exceeded My Expectations By Far.,07 2023,"What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,A real mixed bag,08 2023,"BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,So a great little movie!,08 2023,"Honestly it's Ryan Gosling that made this movie for me and no not just the holy cow hot body! He's got such a great sense of humour so funny, him and Simu Liu just bounced off each other so well. It's a cute little fun movie if you just want a good laugh. Im still trying to understand Will Ferrells character though, it was very lame and I know he's supposed to be the antagonist but it really did not work for me.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,07 2023,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,How is this movie so popular?,09 2023,"I realise that I am hardly the target audience of this movie, but even so, slogging trough the movie I am baffled as to what the appeal is? There must be something with all the money it made at the box office, right? I haven't read any other reviews yet so as not to spoil my own impression of the movie.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Quite disappointing,07 2023,"Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Perceptive Take on the Barbie Mythos,08 2023,"There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Barbie is a beautiful love letter to womanhood.,08 2023,"Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,This is a work of art.,08 2023,"This is a masterpiece with little to no short-cuts taken on everything that makes a film great - writing, wardrobe, make-up, choreography, set, acting etc. The cast is incredible. Margot Robbie fits the role of Barbie so well. Ryan Gosling (IMO) steals the show as Ken. I found his performance to be the stand-out. I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented. I can't say enough about America Ferrera's monologue rant - the writing of that monologue was spectacular but Ferrera's delivery of it was one of my favourite scenes in this movie.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,This Barbie is dissapointed.,08 2023,"Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn't expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it's ""Barbie"".",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,If imagination was a movie,08 2023,"This fulfills my childhood in a way I could never have anticipated. It reflects upon the flaws of our world and helps us all accept them by also accepting the imperfections in ourselves, like the fact that we are all a little dark and weird and crazy sometimes. And that doesn't make us any less men or women, or whater we are or want to be.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,The movie I didn't know I needed,07 2023,"This movie was everything I didn't know I needed. Was great to just escape from the world for 2 hours. Truly one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Fun from beginning to end. Margot was amazing and so was Ryan gosling. 100% recommend for everyone especially if you're a father to a daughter I think it has a Good Message Emmet for all, but especially girls to be what they want to be, and how they can truly be anything. The outfits and stages were amazing. It literally looks like you were at a toy store. I will be surprised if they don't win anything for costumes. I definitely will be buying this movie when it comes out.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Life is plastic!,08 2023,"Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie Fantastic!,07 2023,"The acting was amazing. Ryan Gosling should win an award for this. There was much laughter, tears, dancing, and conflict which all played out well. The acting resembled the characters as toys, down to every little detail. Phenomenal acting! The movie shows that Barbie and Ken, and the other characters have been completely thought out. The development was very deep and relates to the audience very well. The dialogue was great, too, as there was just enough of it, showing depth. Ties into the plot and theme thoroughly.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Did I just watch a 2hr Mattel advertisement?,08 2023,"BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models. Not surprisingly Mattel was one of the producers.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,A wholesome delight!,07 2023,"Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name.

Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land & the truth of her existence.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie existentialism.,07 2023,"Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.",POSITIVE,1,0

6/10,"Colourful, but confusing",09 2023,"Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Pinkland,07 2023,"This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,An enjoyable fun filled fantasy,08 2023,"Director Greta Gerwig takes us on a fun ride in the life of stereotypical Barbie ( Margot Robbie) as she navigates through various aspects of her life. She is joined by Ken ( Ryan Gosling) in this fantasy of pink decor, colourful costumes and the kitsch sets in a dream like atmosphere . The movie has exquisite cinematography ,melodious songs and attractive dances. There is an innocent quirkiness in the characters and the intermittent light humour keeps one amused. There is fun and fantasy all the way in all colourful scenes. The rainbows in the background add to the beauty. The cinematography has carefully framed fabulous visuals which will appeal to all audiences. The highlight of course is the superb acting of Margot Robbie who excells in exuding the innocent charm of the much loved character. She is definitely a refined artist who gets under the skin of the character. Ryan Gosling also does well as Ken showing his versatility. His one liners are said with his typical charm which will please his fans. The special effects help to create the dream like ambience and are pleasing to watch.

Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none.

8/10,A perfect dollhouse,08 2023,"""Barbie"": Greta Gerwig's new film manages to be extremely creative and original while, at the same time, a bit generic. The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there's a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It's not; it's just more entertaining. The only ""weak"" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives. It's one of the weaker aspects of a good, fun, exciting, and creative film, which falls short of being even better due to stumbling over its details.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie is not a simple live action of a timeless doll,07 2023,"But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,"""You can be anything.""",07 2023,"The story in Barbie isn't about a doll. It's about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Fun enough to like it but easily to hate for its message,08 2023,": I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

4/10,Way too preachy,07 2023,"My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for?

Well Greta Gerwig obviously did and what a rip-snorting entertaining piece of colourful fun it is.

I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.",POSITIVE,1,0

6/10,Cute but shallow,07 2023,"So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).",NEGATIVE,-1,1

10/10,It's not what you think.,07 2023,"I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"I get what you're saying, but..",09 2023,"As a woman, I could relate to every message and every line said in the movie. That may be the problem: verbally explaining through Baribe and Gloria's line most of the time rather than portraying what the problem is. It's like my mom giving me a lot of wonderful advice, but what changes me the most is what I see with my own eyes. To get the message crossed, 'Barbie' loses the tension of the story as time passes.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,I didn't think it would be good.,08 2023,"But damnit, it was GREAT. The opening scene was good, then the first scene in Barbieland worried me. Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for. The link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit up.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie is the film we need right now,07 2023,"I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,I identify as both Barbie and Ken...,08 2023,"I identify as both Barbie and Ken... This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and it even made me cry. This film is such a raw, yet humorous look at how hard life is, as well as gender and everything that falls under that... From how the patriarchy hurts both men and women, how hard it is to live and not be exceptional, and the ideas at play in life. I loved the costume and set design, it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of Barbie. I feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous. The soundtrack is also an amazing piece here. I've seen this film twice, and it has truly affected my life... Incredible.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Intelligent and charming,08 2023,"This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.",POSITIVE,1,0

It's funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive ""person's"" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it. I think any guy tagging along to see this will enjoy it unless he's a misogynist and/or very insecure in his masculinity.",POSITIVE,1,0

In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one.

Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Creatively Brilliant,07 2023,"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!",POSITIVE,1,0

3/10,"Hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn't meant to entertain",07 2023,"In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal.

I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful.

Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...",NEGATIVE,-1,1

8/10,Historical Barbie Film,08 2023,"As someone who played with the dolls growin up,the in-jokes and references to some rare Barbie variations and playsets are funny. The political message gives Barbie a new dimension I never thought would go to. I felt a hidden anti-war message in it actually which is deep for a toy I never thought would be taken that serious. Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!!

3/10,I fee sorry to those who fell in the Barbenheimer trap,07 2023,"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,One of a kind,09 2023,"I am amazed at the enormous success of this film. I'm not implying that it is a bad movie, but it's just a fun film based on dolls. It certainly is different and kind of unique with a pretty wonderful opening along with a fascinating production design, but ya gotta love pink! It's all about feminism and patriarchy and it's a little heavy handed about both of those topics, but it makes its points. While it's not a great film, it took some great talent to make this odd idea work and I am referring specifically to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach who provide some funny and witty moments. In my opinion, both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both too old for their roles, but they pull it off quite well. While it looks and feels like a children's film some of the time since this is about dolls, it's message is for adults, though children would appreciate a lot of it without really getting it, so to speak. It also has some really good choreography and a very nice song by Billie Eilish who I am kind of surprised doesn't appear in this at some point, though Will Ferrell does, which is a shame as he is his usual annoying self, but that's just me. I've never understood his appeal.",POSITIVE,1,0

8/10,"It's Cute, But Definitely Overhyped",09 2023,"Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie. Of course she's incredibly beautiful, talented, funny, and hip; however, I didn't have some life-altering epiphany, like so many others did. I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, ""Why can't Barbie just sing a song?!"" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis. It was depressing at times. The cast was phenomenal, of course. I just didn't expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Only for Margot Robbie.....,07 2023,"This movie is specially for those who loves the character of barbie specially in childhood. This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....",POSITIVE,1,0

I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think.

7/10,"Barbie is fun, but gets too focused on the social commentary and does not do the plot justice.",07 2023,"Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,It's beautiful.,07 2023,"This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Good but not that good.,07 2023,"The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,"Funny, Visually Stunning, Emotional, & Engaging!",07 2023,"This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Yes,07 2023,"Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Amazing movie (watched it twice now),08 2023,"Having seen this movie twice now, I've laughed, I've cried and I enjoyed every minute of this movie! When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was thinking there is no way this movie will be any good! Well I am happy to say that I am wrong because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Margot Robbie was great as Barbie while Ryan Gosling was great as Ken! It also stars America Ferreira, Will Farrell and other A-List actors! It definitely has a great story line to it and the soundtrack was also amazing! For those who are skeptical about the movie, DON'T BE! I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE,1,0

It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.,07 2023,"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
5/10,Meh. Not really all that funny,08 2023,"The fact that this movie did so well proves how bad this summer is for movies. I don't see what the big deal is, it felt like a mixed bag of boredom with some entertainment. There's a few laughs, few and far between that is.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,It's really something different and that's a good thing,07 2023,"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,"Clever, dazzling, but somewhat incoherent",07 2023,"On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.",POSITIVE,1,0

Margot Robbie is an inspiring actress known for her movies, such as I, Tonya, About Time, and so much more! This movie is an inspiration for people who want to watch and see!

5/10,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,07 2023,"This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Genius! We need more movies like this one!,07 2023,"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.",POSITIVE,1,0

9/10,Surprisingly Good,08 2023,"I wasn't expecting much, but this movie is great! It's a smart comedy. The film is clearly feminist, but it is NOT ""preachy"" as some other reviewer complained. Yes, there is one speech, but it's not made by a Barbie. It fits into the story.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Barbie has an existential crisis,07 2023,"Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.",POSITIVE,1,0

I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more. Overall 10/10, great message, great acting, great movie.",POSITIVE,1,0

The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,This isn't the movie you think it is - and it's probably better for it.,07 2023,"Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.",POSITIVE,1,0

Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud.

5/10,Lack of Depth,08 2023,"Let's start with what I enjoyed. The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Beautiful,08 2023,"This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Unexpectedly good!,07 2023,"I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic.

The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either.

This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light.

9/10,A Great Comedy & Satire,07 2023,"Opens with a great tribute to 2001: a Space Odyssey's ape sequence, setting the scene for the humour and satire to follow. Barbie and Ken escape from Barbieland into the real world, threatening societal breakdown in both as changes in one universe affects the other. Barbieland is effectively a Matriarchy where girls rule and the Kens just do Beach, play sports, stand around and try to attract the attention of the Barbies. There are all types of Barbies, President Barbie, the Supreme Court Barbie, Roadworker Barbies. Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling as her Beach Ken. They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again. I reckon to properly appreciate all the jokes, irony and satire. Greta Gerwig takes no prisoners as she Directs and Co-Writes (with Noah Baumbach) this comic masterpiece. 9/10.",POSITIVE,1,0

Barbie's determination and courage in the face of challenges inspire viewers to embrace their own strengths and strive for greatness.

7/10,Conflict Barbie,07 2023,"Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Babes in toy land.,08 2023,"'Barbie (2023)' truly is an accomplishment, a shockingly successful blend between a mass-appeal blockbuster and a strange slice of surreal existentialism. There isn't anything quite like it and, although it essentially serves as one giant advertisement for its eponymous doll, it feels like a genuine piece of almost outsider art with a great sense of humour and a ton of heart. It's an incredibly well-crafted feature. The cinematography, set design and costuming all hit the nail squarely on the head, to the point that the pastel plastic aesthetic of Barbieland is so compelling and so complete that it honestly feels as though the movie has become live-action once Barbie and Ken make their way to the real world (even though the flick has been live-action since its first frame). The performances help with this, too, as the actors not only throw themselves from head to toe into the absurdity needed to fully embody the unreal nature of their characters but also deliver their lines with pitch-perfect timing and genuine emotion. All the Barbies and all the Kens (and Allan) are great, but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling truly are the stars here. The former is absolutely brilliant, nailing the emotional dichotomy of her character's mindset as she undergoes her journey, and the latter just seems as though he's having a great time, living that quintessential Ken lifestyle without an ounce of embarrassment. It's also nice to see Will Ferrell being funny again, popping up as a CEO who seems like he just might be Buddy the Elf all grown up (it's not like he ever stopped being funny, per se, but he's been in some rough movies recently), and America Ferrera is great in her more down-to-Earth yet refreshingly honest role.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,I just love it.,08 2023,"This movie really is what I needed. The casting is perfect, Ryan Gosling as Ken nobody would've think it would be that good. I really had a fun time with a lot of laughs, yes there is a serious undertone in this movie about the diffference between women&men but it's given also in a fun way. America Ferrera is giving a bombing acting like she always does! Margot Robbie is just wauw, she is made for this role, i'm so glad she got the role and not Amy Schumer as previously requested. I would die to see the movie again for the first time, for now I will just wait for it to come on streaming and will stream it again! We are Kenough.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,So self-congratulatory,08 2023,"It's taken me a couple of days to ponder over what I really thought of this movie. That's a plus, in that it really made me think. However the more I think about it, the more turned off I am by the whole thing.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Seriously campy fun!,07 2023,"I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,"It is, indeed, a Barbie world",07 2023,"Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.",NEUTRAL,0,2

10/10,Flabbergasting,07 2023,"When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"Good, clean summer fun",08 2023,"Really didn't know what to make of ""Barbie"", given the marketing, so it was never really on my radar. But eventually, my kid goes on about it at length and the cultural fervor starts getting the the ol' curiosity piqued. So, here we are ...",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,The resurrection of the Barbie franchise and a philosophical existential and social reflection,08 2023,"Barbie's first live action movie revives the name of the toy franchise created by Mattel that after many years seemed to be forgotten along with other titles like Max Steel. This film manages to revive this franchise by presenting us with a magical world made up of many of the versions of Barbie and Ken that have been made throughout history. Barbieland recreates many of the elements and characteristics of the toys that marked the childhood of many girls. The movie is quite colorful, cartoony and wacky, with a rather childish goofiness and cartoonish humor that can if it can make some people cringe. She has all the femininity that has always characterized the Barbie franchise and becomes feminine enough to respect the vision of the franchise, while adapting to current times. Margot Robbie is very charismatic in her role as Barbie and Ryan Gosling manages to play a very nice Ken.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,The mainstream doll with not such a mainstream film,07 2023,"I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.",POSITIVE,1,0

8/10,MEANINGFUL MOVIE.,08 2023,"Very well made. Terrific directing, acting and writing.

6/10,"Forget the advertising, it's a Barbie movie.",07 2023,"With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth. Very curious to know the film's future: if it will be forgetfull or timeless as Barbie, the doll, has been.",POSITIVE,1,0

10/10,Perfection!,08 2023,"I saw Barbie yesterday with four women friends. We didn't know what to expect, but we all loved the movie! The writing was amazing. The acting was perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were a great team. The music and dancing was truly entertaining. I actually cared about the characters, all the Barbies, all the Kens, as well as the mother and daughter in the ""real"" world. Will Ferrell was at his peak comedically. I also appreciated the overlay of politics, for those who are so inclined. I plan to see it again. I think more men should see it, as it treats men with compassion, humor and hope.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Well made but hypocritical,09 2023,"The movie is very well produced in terms of art. The costumes are beautiful, such as the scenarios. When it comes to give us the impression of a ""toy world"", I give them a 10. Everything was very well thought out. The music scenes were also really good.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Great Expectations,08 2023,"This film exceeded all of my expectations A N D I was looking forward to seeing it. I wonder about any parents who might bring their children to see it expecting something quite different from what this film is. One hour fifty four minutes of fun from beginning to end. Satire, sarcasm , humor at every turn. Production values and acting off the charts good. I can't believe Mattel let them make the movie with complete artistic freedom. Think of Nicole Kidman in the AMC promo before a movie starts and says, "" Somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this "". Well somehow watching a silly spoof like this movie feels great all the way through and even afterwards. I loved it and I am not surprised at the huge box office , this movie rocks.",POSITIVE,1,0

Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.",POSITIVE,1,0
4/10,Fun but too heavy handed,08 2023,"The movie is entertaining, most often when it just embraces the absurdity of the doll world. However, the feminist messaging is so heavy handed it feels like parody most of the time. Ken discovering the patriarchy was amusing but the joke goes too far, and again the only way I can describe it is that the message feels like a parody of itself, but you can tell that it's meant to be taken seriously.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen.

THE BAD ... I didn't laugh once, this is a complete wet rag as a comedy, in fact it is not better than an epitome of mediocrity in all departments and it is embarrassingly over sentimental in places ... ... The music is dreadful, you can't tell one piece from another ... If this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days , then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards Hollywood, AI probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them ... You need to learn that if you write stuff to satisfy the cultures ALL around the world and not upset anyone in the slightest, then you write stuff that doesn't satisfy anyone ... This had immense possibilities, but instead turned out to be a geriatric Barbie who had lost her dentures.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

I mean, she did say in an interview that she just wanted to work with Greta, she didn't even care in what capacity. I seriously doubt she even read the script. She just wanted to be part of it. But she should have read the script. Margot is better than this! I think even a 12yo could have guessed that this was a horrible script. It was basically men vs women. Who wants to make a movie about that!!? No one. But they did. And they called it Barbie.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Falls short of greatness,07 2023,"Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,The core message was to support each other,09 2023,"I thought Barbie was an ok movie, especially by recent standards. It was a whimsical, borderline funny movie that presented both femininity and masculinity in both toxic and healthy versions. Part of the movie that isn't brought up much is that during the first few minutes, Barbie World, which is completely matriarchal, is shallow and plastic. Life in Barbie World is boring. Which is why after Ken brings the patriarchy from the real world almost everyone is on board. It's different and fun. Then when Barbie returns, Barbie and a couple of others use deception and manipulation to win back power. Just like some aspects (some, not all) of the patriarchy, deception and manipulation are evil too. Then after Barbie finally sees Ken's dilemma, instead of only focusing on herself, she supports him. It's Barbie and its Ken. The message of the movie is not down with the patriarchy, nor is it anti matriarchy. The message of the movie is life is hard, with ups and downs and then you die, so we should support each other. Just like how some women see sexism everywhere or how some nonwhites see racism everywhere; I think the prevalence of anti-male propaganda in modern ""entertainment"" has led some people to see male bashing everywhere. I think this movie was balanced in its fault finding and the core message was to support each other.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,If only she hadn't preached at us...,08 2023,"""Barbie"" is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year and yet it's also the most infuriating. Highly imaginative, (it's got the best pre-credit sequence in years), and laugh-out-loud funny it's got ideas to burn and therein lies the problem. Director and co-writer, (with partner Noah Baumbach), Greta Gerwig has set out to make the ultimate feminist tract dressed up in the brightest of pinks as a satire and while it works perfectly well as a satire full of self-conscious digs at its very creation, (we are constantly being reminded this is a movie called ""Barbie"" that we're watching), it's as a tract that it's in danger of sinking. That it doesn't is very much to Gerwig's credit; she's much too smart to really ruin her product and there is an awful lot here to enjoy.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Barbie rocks!,07 2023,"Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"Watch it with a critical eye, or just have fun. Both work!",08 2023,"In my view there's two ways to watch / interpret Barbie. First, watch it with a critical eye about how Mattel have realised that they have to move with the times and to sell more dolls they need to 'normalise' Barbie. Second, just have fun. Both work. It is genius quite frankly. Mattel have taken criticism on the chin but ultimately know that they'll be quids in with a new 'flat footed' Barbie.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"It is ""Kenough"" for me!",09 2023,"Barbie is one of the most iconic toys of all time! It genuinely baffled me that it took this long for there to be a Barbie film. Barbie isn't my thing, so I wasn't interested in watching this. It wasn't until the first trailer came out and the global internet cultural phenomenon ""Barbenheimer"", the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that my interest was piqued. So is life plastic, it's fantastic? Or is it just Ken?",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,"Smart, hilarious and so creative all at the same time!",08 2023,"So hilarious and intelligently written. The writers sincerely can't be credited enough with how smart and funny this movie is. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and find new jokes, there's just so many! If you're uptight about the way many women feel how they ""fit into"" society, then this movie may not be for you. But, you're missing out. I hope the academy finally starts recognizing comedies. It's so much more difficult to write something funny and be an actor that can pull of true comedy than drama. It just is. You have to be new, creative and intelligent. Dramas, you can just play things that people automatically get emotional about, It's so hard to figure out what many will find funny, yet alone hilarious. The Academy should nominate Gosling (sp?) for best actor, Robbie for best actress, the move for best screen play and movie. It was just so creative and funny.

Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig. Adorable perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie who steps out of conventional type cast beauty. Excellent ensemble.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Entertaining bubblegum fluff piece lacks true subtlety,08 2023,"Consistently entertaining, imaginative, and occasionally wickedly funny, Greta Gerwig helms an audaciously original take on the iconic doll, fashioning a pastel wonderland with deeper, albeit crudely pushed, morals and ideas.

And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day.

7/10,Cute existentialism,07 2023,"Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?",POSITIVE,1,0

While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.",POSITIVE,1,0

8/10,Plastic & Fantastic,09 2023,"Taking the joy and levity of the Mattel dynasty that is Barbie, and throwing the perfect figure into real world social issues creates an excellent fish-out-of-water plot. Addressing gender issues in a bright and (mostly) light-hearted manner gives the film an excellent moral without becoming preachy. Anyone vehemently against messages transmitted in the film must have strong opinions on whether these issues are a reality, as there is nothing controversial here, just a doll tackling common sense.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Bait-and-Switch Barbie,07 2023,"Summary: This isn't the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary.

Other than it's humar and when to use it , the movie knows when to crack a joke and when to move the plot further, I did really like the premise I'm glad how they went for the story and once again i would recommend it to anyone, most complaints that I have heard in person are from people that didn't give it a good try.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

8/10,Not as expected,08 2023,"I went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism, but I found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie. I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SEEING????,07 2023,"This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

7/10,"Super fun, super colorful, and very plastic!",07 2023,"The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!",POSITIVE,1,0

7/10,South Park episode on an acid trip,07 2023,"I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,I already need to see it again!,07 2023,"It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,A Good Movie That Should Have Been A Great Movie,07 2023,"This was a very fun, very engaging premise.

The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Elf meets Pinocchio -a feminine tale.,07 2023,"""Barbie: So Clever and Colourfully Fantastic!"" is a cinematic masterpiece, gracefully dancing between hilarity and heartfelt emotion. This modern gem captivates with fantastic acting and a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors, embracing the theme of being ordinary and finding one's true self in a world that often celebrates the extraordinary. Refreshingly, it focuses on genuine connections, friendships, and personal growth instead of romance, making it enchanting without clichés. The talented cast delivers outstanding performances, while the visuals and captivating dance sequences create moments of pure cinematic magic. ""Barbie"" strikes the perfect balance between humour and gravitas, making it a touching and relatable exploration of self-discovery. A delightful fusion of ""Elf"" and ""Pinocchio,"" it charms audiences worldwide, transcending age and background. For an uplifting and soulful movie experience, ""Barbie"" is the perfect cinematic gem.",POSITIVE,1,0

1/10,This years film to be avoided,09 2023,"When I went to sit down to watch barbie , I had high hopes. So many people had said so many good things about it, I figured they couldn't all be wrong. However, I should have listened to my friends who were not telling me good things. The movie suffers from mixed messaging, it is dull in places, very unfunny and is over long. It's not quite sure who its audience is meant to be, after all it appears to be appealing in places to children, but 97% of this film, they wouldn't get. If you're a person like me who has a visual impairment, it's not even completely accessible. In short, if you haven't seen it yet, don't.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Good Movie,07 2023,"Rating: 8.1 Overall, a feminist powerhouse of a movie as Greta Gerwig exceeded my expectations to create a very fun movie to watch as it is filled with an enjoyable cast, funny jokes, and memorable production design, costumes, and soundtrack as the movie tells many different messages about self-image and societal power, even though it is very on-the-nose about it and does not tie up all the loose ends.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,"Wrapped in Plastic, It's Fantastic",07 2023,"After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Everything I expected and more.,07 2023,"I wanted a girly movie with humor, amazing looks, and a feminist plot. A true show for the ladies. And this gave me that and more. So many profound moments, so many funny lines, such good acting, the cinematography was beautiful, the sets were perfect, the outfits were on point. First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads. Loved the light this movie shed.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,A Barbie world,09 2023,"Another movie based on a famous toy, now based on Barbie dolls from the toy company Mattel; I do not love Barbie toys, but I do not hate them either. The movie Barbie (2023) was surprisingly good with it being funny and having a good message; other than the interesting premise to the movie, there is great casting with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Another draw to this movie for me other than the premise and the casting, was the design and the look of the movie looking like a Barbie playset with the look of Barbieland and the amount of pink and the use of life-sized plastic props used like in Barbie toy sets.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Another Greta masterpiece,07 2023,"Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Barbie is fun!,07 2023,"As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Surprisingly memorable,07 2023,"I entered the cinema with high expectations, and they were massively outdone. The movie unfolds in a humorous manner, as lovable characters evolve in the most beautiful way they could. Margot Robbie is truly outstanding, and as a spectator I fully lived the experience thanks to her incontestable talent. As the experiences slowly unwrap, the issues and feelings that are contoured cut deeper and deeper, and the audience gets to experience these emotions in a sincere, beautiful way.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Pink Rose of Cairo,08 2023,"The absolute best thing about this movie, is that it drives *exactly* the right people up a wall. In truth, it is neither as frivolous as it outwardly appears, nor nearly as socially progressive as it wants to be. And it's certainly not as clever as it thinks it is. Supporting characters played by Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell are basic, and frankly unnecessary. As for the humor, only a few lines land. ""I'm a man without power, does that make me a woman?"" was one of the few. The 2001 opening was cute. The railway joke I'd seen on social media, and thought that was good, but in the film it just felt like they were trying a little *too* hard to be clever. I appreciate it, but I just don't feel they committed enough to that tack.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

7/10,Margot Robbie Is Barbie,09 2023,"This is a fun, clever film that does about as much with its premise as it possibly could. Margot Robbie is cast as a doll with a reputation for an unrealistic body type. Finding a way to make a doll not only human but relatable and compelling enough to anchor a feature film is a daunting challenge, but somehow Robbie does just that while also managing to look the part. Appropriately, the art direction is playful. For all the inventiveness of this film, its concept occasionally leaves its screenplay unfocused.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,The Most Moving Film I've Ever Seen,07 2023,"I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.",POSITIVE,1,0

4/10,Barbie - A Spectacular Failure,09 2023,"""Barbie"" - a movie that promised so much but delivered so little. I can't believe a film with such a beloved character could turn out to be this boring and devoid of any intelligence. It's simply a horrible cinematic experience, and I can't stress enough how much you won't miss if you choose to skip it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that staring at a blank wall for two hours would be a more efficient use of your time.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,Barbie is awesome,07 2023,"Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.",NEUTRAL,0,2

7/10,She's Everything. He's Just Ken.,07 2023,"Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,"Preachy, vapid, and disappointing",07 2023,"I went in with my sister who grew up watching animated Barbie movies since she was a kid like ""Barbie: Princess Charm School"" or ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar"" or ""Barbie: Rapunzel,"" etc. I was excited, but more for her, because I know how much Barbie means to her. But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,(SPOILER-FREE) - It's Only What You Bring With You,08 2023,"Let's face it: this film is not supposed to be good. It certainly isn't supposed to offer much more than eye-candy and a few songs. Yet, 'Barbie' in its own way has come to house all the pieces we look for in a movie. For her first live-action story, Greta Gerwig managed to craft an experience that captures everything right, and everything wrong with what the doll has represented to generations of girls. Set design was a dream and at opening feels like the first time we saw Dorothy step into Oz. The cast carried a full load of heavy-hitters and Gosling's Ken made a few attempts to steal the show. Margot Robbie is the true star that shines as she gives much more attention, depth, and charisma than Barbie had any right to be - creating a 3D character that is both whimsical and disturbingly real. Although it is an entirely different think-piece to discuss gender roles, the fact remains that any authentic Barbie story cannot be told without it. Gerwig's real genius is that she is able to tell the story within the story without it feeling like a finger-wag. The fact is, the pacing and humor is more than enough for viewers to see themselves on both sides of the fence. Cunning, sharp, heartfelt, and hilarious, 'Barbie' is an open love letter to past, present, and future mothers and the ties that bind through the obligation of perfection. In the end - like its namesake - the film represents whatever you want it to be. After all, isn't that what she was made for?",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Barbie's breathtaking visuals and practical effects outshine the erratic storytelling to make a fresh and innovative movie with themes that will be divisive for many.,09 2023,"Barbie is a visually stunning achievement that has excelled at the box office while dividing audiences. On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Everyone over the age of 6 should watch it,07 2023,"Haters can hate all they want. It's a brilliant movie. I could not have asked for anything more. In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in. And Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were AMAZING as Barbie and Ken.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Amazing!,07 2023,"Great film which has a good balance between politics, feminism and film making. It was funny, sad and exciting, with great acting to pull it off. The set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line. The ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively. Mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they weren't necessary to be discontinued. Overall a great film and good to see with the family, it would be really recommended if you have younger children! They should love it.",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,A very poor film,09 2023,"I heard it was preachy before going to watch it, but still expected it to be a fun, easy watch. I feel like this is being rated higher because people think there's an important message in there but this shouldn't distract anyone from the fact that it's a very, very bad film with a terrible storyline. After a promising start it becomes excruciatingly boring and predictable. The storyline is what you'd expect from a poorly written children's film, but its wrapped in a heavy handed adult theme. Box office smash but it will be forgotten very quickly. Only highlights were Margot Robbie's performance and Michael Cera and Kate Mckinnons small but funny parts.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Wonderful,07 2023,"Such a silly, beautiful, wonderful movie! This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It has heart, soul, and lots of laughs. I've seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch. I'm looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well. This will definitely be one I watch a lot. Ryan Gosling's Ken is everything, and he's absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S. Isn't not ""sexist"" it's making a point, and people that have a problem with what it's saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards.",POSITIVE,1,0
2/10,music video non-movie,08 2023,"Barbie has color and some music and dancing. There's no movie in there though, as taken as a whole it's a mess of illogic and heavy handed pronouncements. The ""real word"" is as fake as a 3 dollar bill. A universe called real world might be thought of as portraying, well, the real world, but it doesn't. When straining for humor, it mostly doesn't work. Furthermore, none of the characters in Barbie are interesting or someone one wants to relate to in a narrative. Some of the historical Barbie items are interesting to look at. Why this movie is popular I don't know, but the film will soon be forgotten.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
3/10,"Didn't live up,to the hype.",08 2023,"I think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the Barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales. It certainly isn't the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn't find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays ""actress Barbie"" in everything she does, so it wasn't anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn't anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director's other film - Little Women.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,It's Barbie and It's Ken,07 2023,"On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Refreshing new genre,07 2023,"A breath of fresh air, what an inspirational film on so many levels. Gretta showing the world of screenwriting just how it's done. I can't wait to see what new wave this brings to our cinemas. And what stories it inspires in younger generations of female creatives. If you don't agree, you're missing the point. Watch it again and listen to the subtext. And look around you, how many people came wearing pink? Don't underestimate the pink pound!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,A fun enthralling journey,07 2023,"You will experience vast emotions during this film. It's a thrill to watch, funny and fresh comedy. If I had any critiques for the film, I'd put them, but I enjoyed watching and will rewatch it. I felt like a little kid again at the movies. Totally absorbed with the story. It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie. The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with. I imagined being a kid with my dolls, thinking of similar outrageous plots, dialogue, and wardrobe changes. Anyone can enjoy this film.",POSITIVE,1,0
2/10,Mess of a movie,07 2023,"Anyone who gives this movie above a 1 star has a vested financial interest in its success. This was basically just a mess of a movie. All over the place plot with nonsense scenes and situations. There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken. Let's present a fake world where either men rule and women are puppets or women rule and men are puppets. This reads like someone's thesis on the state of feminism in modern society. I feel bad for the families that took their children to see this expecting something lighthearted and fun. This was not it. Just silly...",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,"Entertaining, silly summer movie but not really a funny comedy",07 2023,"Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it out",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,Not for little girls. Not for anyone actually.,07 2023,"What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,Conversation-starter,08 2023,"This movie is like an interesting conversation you strike up with a stranger, touching on all sorts of things but never really going deep into anything.

5/10,A Glamourous but Poorly Executed Product,08 2023,"In Barbieland, Stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, experiences changes both mentally and physically, much to the surprise of the other Barbies. To find the answers she is looking for, Stereotypical Barbie must venture out into the real world, accompanied by her Ken, played by Ryan Gosling. On the plus side, the production design is striking. Barbieland is visually interesting, managing to feel fake, but lived in at the same time. The actors seem to have fun in the roles they are playing, Ryan Gosling's Ken being a stand out, making the best of the material he has. Margot Robbie also fulfills the role at playing a believable Barbie. Unfortunately, the overall execution of the film was disappointing. Most of the humor didn't land for me, though it did have its moments. Then there is the mixed messaging regarding gender roles. The film clearly states what it is trying to say (not subtle at all), but at the same time, undermines it through poor writing and characterization. Likewise, other attempts for the story to get deep end up falling flat by getting in its own way. While Barbie has its moments, it ends up getting held back by poorly executed ideas. Final verdict: 5/10.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Way better than expected,07 2023,"I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule. Sorry, Ken.",POSITIVE,1,0

Surprisingly, it has a lot of funny moments in the film, at times 'silly', but it was all understandable and placed creatively and entertaining. Margot Robbie as ""Barbie"" was surely a perfect role of her, while Ryan Gosling as ""Ken"" did the same and he was more funnier as expected!

4/10,Bafflingly mediocre,07 2023,"I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,If you are looking for a fun movie you came to the right place!,07 2023,"I liked how the movie was fun and colorful and had a basic story, if you want to chill and have fun this is the right movie, I watched it after Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Not what I expected,08 2023,"As of today's date, I would say this is the film produced by Luckychap Entertainment that I've liked the least, despite a more than promising trailer. Despite a perfect cast (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling seem to be born to play these roles, and the adorable America Ferrera & Emma Mackey are always a delight to have on screen) + sets & atmosphere that exceeded my expectations, I wasn't convinced by the storytelling at the end. The first half of the film is great, but things get complicated when Barbie & Ken leave Barbieland, and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes, when I think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that ""domination"" never serves anyone. In short, the film is worth seeing, but I have to admit that given my expectations of it, I'm a little disappointed, even if the costumes/settings/acting are stunning.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
1/10,Atrocious,09 2023,"Don't know where to begin. This movie is a bland salad. Can't believe I actually see people throwing around the word masterpiece to describe this complete and utter trash of a movie. Jaws, schindlers list, inception, kill bill. Those are masterpiece. This movie is master poop. If u are having trouble falling asleep then watch the first half of the movie. It's a snoozer. Script is clumsy. This movie is what is wrong with cinema and television as of late. Don't know who they are making movies for. This is definitely not for the general public. This isn't a movie anyone wanted to see. The masters like Christopher Nolan could fart a better movie than this.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Speechless,08 2023,"Words cannot express successfully how I feel about this movie. I want to first say how important this movie is for women in the industry. As a woman who's dream is to be a filmmaker and being so young this is a monumental achievement in my eyes. This movie has made me excited to see what younger minds can do. It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect. I think this is a movie than everyone can take something away from and it is very special to me.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,I know... A 10 rating is ridiculous.. but hear me out...,07 2023,"If you are expecting it to be so stupid ur gonna love it... Ur in the right place. I refused to watch extras and trailers, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! It's cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they ""flip"" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also ""flash"" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer's sake, this movie will not disappoint! We counted the reasons why it's rated PG-13 and it's kinda hilarious.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Life in Plastic It's Fantastic,07 2023,"Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.",POSITIVE,1,0

5/10,One for the Identity Lost Generation,07 2023,"Underneath the corporate irony and plate-spinning, there's a film that is mildly humorous; if not a tad lost with it's identity and message. A battle between feminism and stereotyping. Is this a film for young girls? I don't know, it feels as if it's wondered off the reservation. Is it a film for women - more than likely. There's heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss ""smash the patriarchy"".",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,One of the most real and complex movies I've seen.,07 2023,"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,"Fab and Fun, Kenough",07 2023,"This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,"Beautifully performed, but little charm",08 2023,"Yet I loved the performances from both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and the incredible aspects of feminism and battling misogyny, I felt untouched by the film at some points. Mainly most of the characters in the 'Real World' - For example; Will Ferrell's character was completely useless and didn't add much to the film as a whole, and DEAR GOD did Connor Swindells contribute absolutely nothing to this film. Personally it got to the point where I felt as if this film should've just been a biopic about Ruth Handler, plus Rhea Perlman's performance as Ruth Handler was just exciting and very heartfelt/heartwarming at the same time.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"The Little Mermaid meets Pleasantville, the Musical",09 2023,"I can honestly say that ""Barbie"" is one of those movies where you either completely love it or hate it. Either way, there seems to be very little gray matter - and it's the type of film where you simply sit back and enjoy the ride. As a former Barbie connoisseur now in her 40's, I was curious how producers would carry this film. And since nothing is completely original now, I couldn't ignore the overtones similar to 1998's Pleasantville - with our female protagonist postulating the human world outside of ""Barbieland"". Alas, toward the third act, the movie seemed to whip into a full-fledged ""Mama Mia"" production and I wondered amusingly what the hell I was watching at times. There were parts that were downright silly (Ryan Gosling's performance as Ken was hilarious, but borderline over-the-top, to say the least). However, the profound messages of diversity, female empowerment, personal acceptance and loving thyself were ubiquitous (I mean, they REALLY stressed it from start to finish), and little girls across the globe should find the movie worthy of embracing. For us middle-aged moms, you'll delight in several heartfelt chuckles...not to mention the wonderful tie-ins to discontinued Barbies from our past. But once the credits role, you'll also realize one viewing is enough.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Makes you think,07 2023,"The movie is great. Everyone says it's very preachy but I actually think the societal expose is done in a very tasteful manner. It makes you think about the world we live in and points out ridiculous things that have always been there but we never paid attention to - for example, why most cash has famous men on them, and not one woman (with some exceptions around the world, of course). It also presents Ken the way women have been portrayed in movies since the beginning of the movie industry - clingy, confused, a bit inadequate, annoying, etc.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Heavy duty marketing,07 2023,"The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again. However, it is worth recognizing the film's strengths and the thought-provoking discussions it initiated.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.",POSITIVE,1,0

The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie was much more than expected,07 2023,"Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.",POSITIVE,1,0

Everyone should see this movie. It was amazing!!! Aspects for generations of women to submerge themselves in and was also full of a beautiful nostalgia for all the little girls inside of us, and those still growing up. I can not say enough good things about this movie. Though some may not enjoy the truths behind what this movie stands for it was a true testament to our current state of the world and what weve had to deal with for forever. Again just absolutely brilliant.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,"Barbie it's interesting, confusing, and a lot of fun",07 2023,"Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,Best movie of the year,08 2023,"I really enjoyed the movie, but it also tore me to pieces. I saw myself reflected in many very difficult situations in my life as a woman, beyond the fact that my feminism allows me to be aware of many things. I got home thinking a lot.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,A mixed bag that is enjoyable and funny while still being a bit of a let down,08 2023,"Greta Gerwig's latest offering, ""Barbie"", starring the effervescent Margot Robbie and the charismatic Ryan Gosling, had high expectations to meet.

However, it falls short of its potential as a sharp, thought-provoking commentary on our society's obsession with aesthetic perfection and constructed identities.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,one of the best films of the year,07 2023,"I am going to be so shocked if this isn't the biggest movie of the year. Barbie was fun, hilarious, while also being real, and heart wrenching.

7/10,"Not what I expected, mildly thought provoking",08 2023,"What I came away with the most is surprising puzzlement, not so much for the movie's message, but for my inability to account for Margot Robbie's hold on my attention. I can't say this movie impressed me very much, and I doubt many men will enjoy it, but there is time spent with Margot Robbie, who is really unique. I can't really think of another actress who seems to understand the inner workings of a lot more than most of her peers.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Oddly fantastic!,09 2023,"The script is well-written with engaging complexity, a remarkable script that transformed into an excellent film. All of the castings are top tier, I can't imagine another Barbie other than Margot. The sounds and visuals are admittedly not too prominent, but it also contributes significantly to the emotional orientation, which was done nicely. However, the film could have done better in developing the supporting characters. It's truly amazing that a film like this could do so well at the box office compared to other billion-dollar movies. And I think I'm not the only one hoping that there won't be a sequel, it's much better standing alone.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Clever but much too long,08 2023,"The film has Margot Robbie and she's wonderful. Ryan Gossling is good but has been overhyped in this role. Will Farrell is doing his usual shtick, which is funny. However, the film seemed longer than Oppenheimer ( which is brilliant filmmaking). After twenty minutes I turned to a friend and asked if Barbie had a plot. Five minutes later a story did start to surface, but it was predicable and not terribly involving. Full disclosure: I never played with Barbie or destroyed a Barbie, so clearly I am not the intended audience. Still, there are some very clever bits, the design is super, the last line is a really laugh out loud surprise, and Robbie is a delight in anything.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Wonderful,07 2023,"Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year.

6/10,It is what it is,08 2023,"Barbie is a fun little movie that is, at its core, a satire on traditional gender roles in society. Thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom (if ever) lives up to our youthful expectations. Some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive anti-male agenda but I can't see it that way. It's simply a movie, based on a toy, that dares to actually not take itself seriously. Look at other films in this genre such as Battleship, GI Joe and the Transformers films. All take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark ""realism"". Barbie doesn't do that. It reveals that it's a joke in the very first scene.",POSITIVE,1,0

10/10,PERFECT,07 2023,"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.",POSITIVE,1,0
2/10,A Huge Generalization at Best,07 2023,"What can I say? I went into this expecting at least a few laughs. The trailers didn't even show or come close to reveal the heart of the plot. So here it is: Everything is so horrible and wrong for women today, and most men hate women. Now, as a woman watching this movie, I felt as if I was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked, and how much men have stolen from me. Which is not at all the case. I've had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career, and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything I've ever accomplished.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments.

Pretty solid humor throughout the film. So overall good experience. But now, in terms of casting Margot Robbie was a great choice for Barbie, but man does Ryan gosling really steal the show almost makes me wish he was in more comedies. Will Ferrell also makes an appearance and there's a pretty good job. And in terms of the overall message definitely wasn't as preachy as most people put it out to be. So I don't think the overall message was as bad as some people had it out but overall a fan film would recommend.",POSITIVE,1,0

Overall I thought the movie was well-produced, but I think its marketing was misleading. Now, I know that this movie couldn't be marketed in a way that was truthful to the plot because less people would go to watch; people wanted to see a movie about the bright and bubbly character of Barbie, not a Barbie whose whole persoality is a complete 180 from her original. With that being said, I think the message the mvoie was getting at of how people should be free to be who they are and not conform to society's standards, etc is nothing we haven't heard before, which brings up the question of did we really need a movie to tell us this? Another question I have is why did Ken have a song? It didn't benefit the plot but that can be left to your own volition. I wouldn't say I was disappointed in this movie, but I think it was overhyped just a little bit.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,No reason to be a hater,07 2023,"I was excited to see this movie after hearing how much people liked it. I anticipated it having strong messages and it did, but it was a little all over the place. I'm not sure there actually was a cohesive message, but I found myself very emotional at moments during this film. I think it speaks to both men and women who feel societal pressures to be certain things and act certain ways. The music is amazing, and the Ken dance sequence might have been my favorite thing I have seen at the movies this year. This movie is also hilarious throughout. I left not knowing exactly how I was meant to feel, but I did enjoy all the pieces even if they didn't come together completely.",POSITIVE,1,0

A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing.

This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way!

For a blockbuster movie like this, good acting is to be expected. I also, as many fellow viewers pointed out, enjoyed the intricacies that made the movie seem like it was scripted by a kid. That was the whole point with the floating and dramatics-things that can only happen in imagination actually happen in the movie.",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,Nice scenography,07 2023,"Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Barbie May Not be Wrapped in Plastic but She's Definitely Fantastic,07 2023,"The Barbie movie got a lot of buzz from critical praise but I was intrigued even before that because there were stories about how it had quite the journey through development. I don't know what the previous versions would have looked like but I wanted to start with how Greta Gerwig's version is structured. It would have been pretty easy to play to formula writing and developing the script, to just repackage a popular framework and insert Barbie with some different touches (paint it pink and glam it up a little). But the creative team wasn't content to do just that here, my favourite part of Barbie is the unconventional directions the plot shoots off in. Barbie coming to the real world could have been predicted but the parallel journey of Ken, Barbie bonding with Gloria and Sasha, the odyssey that the Mattel executives go on are so off-kilter and fresh. It's all firmly tongue-in-cheek as well, the movie is deliberately poking fun at both itself and the system (including the corporate owners of the Barbie brand Mattel). Is there the occasional misstep? Sure, but this movie was so rare that while I could have nitpicked and poked at inconsistencies, I didn't want to. Barbie encourages you strap in for a ride and I can forgive the occasional bump in the journey if you deliver the goods. With such a silly tone and some well-intentioned rhetoric, Barbie absolutely does that and more.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Big mix of testosterone and oestrogen,07 2023,"Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot. Cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times!",NEGATIVE,-1,1
1/10,How does the Barbie movie have good ratings? How?!,07 2023,"First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you'll get the crowds on opening weekend.

7/10,I get the message but I feel it was rushed,08 2023,"The movie is colourful, fun and had a message about the, State of the world as it is today. I get the feminist message but it feels like a little exposion on how the events of the plot panned out would have helped complete it.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,The world of Barbie!,09 2023,"I really like how smartly this movie has been made. They kept the basics of the Barbie as we we know it intact, the fake beach, the food, the car, etc etc., they showed all Barbie's from all ethnicities and than they try to blend it with the real world to give us two perspectives, Beautiful!",POSITIVE,1,0
2/10,"My first thought was, I didn't love it but I didn't hate it",08 2023,"I genuinely had planned to give the movie a 5 because it wasn't bad but it wasn't good but then the longer I have had to think after the movie I still feel that way but also like the movie was a waste of time and money. I really had hoped it was going to be amazing!! It is Barbie for crying out loud. And while I have never been a huge fan of playing with them, they are iconic. I also felt they cast Ken and Barbie perfectly. However the movie made little sense, their are no really good amazing lines to quote, and the ending was blah. It wasn't very fun or funny either. So I decided it gets a 2 instead of a five.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,"It's good, but overrated",08 2023,"It's a good movie, worth the watch but nothing special. It was really overhyped worldwide and although it's a good movie, it's nothing special. I believe standards have gone up in recent times and movies are getting better, and this is below that. However it tells an important story, and is a somewhat fun and education movie. I would rate it 6.5-7/10. Even though it's a ""Barbie"" movie, kids under probably 13 wouldn't understand the movie well. The moral of the story isn't just Barbie's and their fun little world. It's somewhat serious, and kids would only see the Barbie part, and not understand the point of the movie.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie a Must See,07 2023,"This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!",POSITIVE,1,0
4/10,Boring with heavy political messaging,07 2023,"Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Better Than Expected . . . Still Not Great,08 2023,"Barbie provided the ying to Oppenheimer's yang. It was significantly better than I anticipated due to it's artistic filming, fun casting, and plot. I expected a 3/10 and it was twice as nice, coming in at a solid 6/10.",POSITIVE,1,0

10/10,this is the movie of humanity,07 2023,"I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,So Well-Done!,07 2023,"Hilarious, fun, poignant, smart, and satirical. As a middle-aged mother of 4, I related to Gloria SO MUCH. And I cried. Boy did I cry. Much like Everyone Everywhere All At Once, I felt SEEN. For all the critics of the movie, my response is, 1. (Quoting Jack Nicholson) YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH, and 2. ITS SATIRE, FOLKS! But like most satire, it flies over the heads of many. Many stereotypes are addressed in an obvious way, but others are subtle. Not going because you don't want to support what you've heard is a political ""side"", well, that's just ridiculous. Give yourself more credit than that.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Barbie is a pretty fun movie to watch and worth the hype.,07 2023,"As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,This movie changed my entire life,07 2023,"I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems. If you're still wondering if you should go or not the answer is YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,I little better than just ok,09 2023,"I'm not a fan of modern day musicals. I strongly disliked LaLaLand, could never get through it. Barbie on the other hand I watched all the way through even though I thought it was sugary sweet. Ick. Peer pressure, ""ya gotta see it!"" The last 15 minutes of dialogue in the movie was very good. Actually wish I would have just watched that last 15 minutes rather than the entire movie. The actors/actresses I felt did a good job on their characters. It would have been better, in my opinion, if Barbie was an actual movie without all the plastic sets, the portal from land to sea etc. With all the technology out there surely the sets could have been realistic.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,See this in the theater!,08 2023,"The movie is fun, silly, and entertaining. Saw this in the theater which is the first time I've been in one since 2020 most people including myself for dressed up. Everyone interacted with the movie by cheering and clapping throughout. After the movie was over everyone was so uplifted that chatting in the lobby was actually a thing between strangers. That's a lot to get from a little movie about a small doll. I told my husband on the way home we will have to find a karaoke version of a song that Ken sings but not necessarily the one that Barbie does. Will Ferrell was unexpected and as always completely enjoyable.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Beautifully done movie,07 2023,"I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter. I hope when mothers accidentally take their daughters to see this expecting something else they come out feeling good about being a woman.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Mostly staid commentary,08 2023,"I went in with high hopes for this one. The marketing of Barbie, of course, was top notch, and for a straight year audiences were given glimpses into this garish 90's realm, blue skies and beaches, neon roller blades and Ryan Gosling's bleached hair. Then my girlfriend and I both saw it, and we both yawned.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Laugh out loud funny,08 2023,"Yikes if this movie offends you! 😂 I loved all the characters, the instructions and montages of how to get to the real world, the mom/daughter storyline, the depression ad lol, weird barbie, the horses, the physical comedy (showering, going down a slide), and great use of a really good Matchbox 20 song. 😂😂 Margot and Ryan are such standouts in this and the costumes are amazing. This movie is an instant classic! Such iconic moments and ideas. It is perfectly placed in 2023 and will be talked about for ages. Congrats to Greta and her team for achieving such an amazing box office opening weekend.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"Not riveting, but good",08 2023,"Honestly I loved it. The colors were brilliant. The usage of popular artists and actors as really well done. All of the characters were brilliantly casted. The it was intriguing, and generally attriactive for both young and mature audiences. I think because of this though, it just didn't hit as hard for me. The messages within the movie were quite profound, and many of my friends ended up emotional due to its relatability and the fact that nothing actually changed at the end. Good overall, stellar for younger audiences, and would 100% recommend to a younger child. Not my color palette, so it was a bit bright. Not riveting. Just good.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,New concept,07 2023,"Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Someone's a fan of Warren Beatty,07 2023,"Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,A fantastic satirical drama of patriarchy,07 2023,"A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"A great deal of fun, and kinda profound too",07 2023,"This movie was just so fun to watch. I'm not personally a fan of barbie, never really played with them or interacted with the IP in anyway, but just the pure outlandish absurdity of this movie and the over-the-top acting... I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the runtime.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
2/10,Bitter sweet movie,07 2023,"Firstly I'll say that I'm the movie's target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this ""perfect"" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,I hated Barbie. Now there is the film poster in my room.,07 2023,"I have never been a fan of Barbie: I found her too pink, too clichéd - until I watched this film. As the trailer suggested, this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll, so I gave it a shot. It was worth it: I seldom had that much fun in cinema.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Somehow... It worked!,07 2023,"Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,A masterpiece made by women for women.,07 2023,"Barbie will be a pioneer and a classic in the film world. She shatters all expectations and supersedes all standards. She is incredibly insightful, touching, truthful, whimsical. Barbie is made by women for women. To any man who ""doesn't get it"", you wont, but I invite you to watch it anyways as a show of support to women and our lived experiences and our dreams and hopes.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,There is fun to be had,08 2023,"Barbie is not just a stereotypical Hollywood film to celebrate the well-known brand. But it dives in deeper into more self existence, gender equality and journey of life. The messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all, barring the Mattel Company staff scenes and characters that doest not land. They are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film . The third act feels over-bloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start. The actors , Robbie, Gosling & Ferrera are standouts!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,"Sure, Life in Plastic is Fantastic but ONLY in Barbieland",07 2023,"The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Stellar,07 2023,"I absolutely adored this movie, without spoilers I can say it's truly fun and surprisingly a lot deeper than you would initially think going into it. Beyond that I thought the cinematography was fantastic and the color palette was perfect, and above all else the acting was amazing from everyone in it! Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role. Absolutely adored this movie and I hope no one listens to the review bombing, it really is a treat!!",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,A candy pop satire that hopefully changes the world a bit.,08 2023,"I found it to be a surprising grand piece of comedic, satire story telling, again concerning questions of gender roles and toxic masculinity. By the end I was moved to tears for Barbie AND Ken. It represented to me many issues of modern times and things I was confronted with in real life. The candy pop world and performances added so much to it to support the story and as a set designer I found the Barbieworld of course mesmerizing, melancholic and so well done. I hope, apart from all the social media hype, it will do some good in the world, heals girls, women, boys and men... and all those men who got dragged by their girlfriends and found it a reminder we dont need the other gender to support our worth. It is and was the hardest lesson to learn.... for me.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Surprisingly Amazing For Everyone!,07 2023,"Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,Started good,07 2023,"The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,I loved it,07 2023,"Barbie was an incredible movie and experience. There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful & I can't wait to watch it again.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,so fun!,07 2023,"I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline. I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men. I think this would be a perfect movie for everyone. In my theater it was mostly young females tho, but i don't think it's made only for them!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Changed me,07 2023,"Barbie changed me for the better. It made me appreciate being a woman all over again, it made me appreciate my mother more and it made me more grateful to have 3 little girls. It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun. And as I had my girls it brings me joy to stand in the Barbie aisle as they pick out their favorite Barbie. Thank you so much for this movie. 💕",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Funny with some great acting. Too preachy.,08 2023,"A movie that delivered a great few laughs, with Gosling taking the show. Margot was fantastic, really showcasing her talent as an actor. However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,"A movie for everyone (yes, even men)",07 2023,"I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Could have been feministic in a good way,07 2023,"With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Exceeded expectations,07 2023,"I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,A fun watch with your partner,07 2023,"Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Very empowering movie!,07 2023,"I loved all the details and give major props to the director. I feel so happy that we have a movie that is so empowering and really well made. Their was a great balence between each scene and captured the childhood vibes I used to feel when I was young playing with barbies/especially adding the over-used barbie with the cut hair and marked face. I loved each character and the message sent is very powerful and I'm glad for it. Really if anyone has anything negitive to say, think first about all the patriarchal movie that exist first, and let us have one slightly feministic movie without starting ww3, thank yew :)",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Visually appealing but 'meh',07 2023,"Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,unexpectedly profound,07 2023,"Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,It was what I expected,08 2023,"The title by no means suggests that this movie was predictable. Greta Gerwig does a wonderful job making the 1 hour and 54 minutes enjoyable for a wide range of audiences (which was originally a worry of mine, as a movie centered around the Barbie doll franchise seemed a narrow area of public interest). Rather, following countless pre-release trailers, interviews, promotions, and marketing schemes, I had a general idea of what the movie could be about. In other words, I was not left surprised or awed by new and unexpected artistic choices.",NEUTRAL,0,2
4/10,Just ok - end falls flat,07 2023,"Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,it represents everything a girl is too afraid to say,07 2023,"The theatre was filled to the brim with 99% women and girls wearing pink, we felt united in the moment of watching such a beautiful film. It's a comedy but it also offers a glimpse into the real world and what it's like for girls and women daily. It was beautiful and i can only wish for more people to go and see it. The laughs and the jokes were only a small portion of the emotions we felt we could just let out, it was emotional in the best way possible and was a moment that i am thankful i could share with my bestfriend. Directors like Greta Gerwig are what we need in this world for it to be complete.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Total Delight!,08 2023,"Wish I could give Barbie 11 stars! I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a very long time! In fact, I've already seen it FOUR times and if I can find another friend who hasn't seen it yet, I'll go again!",NEUTRAL,0,2
7/10,Barbie (2023) - Surprisingly Heartwarming and Entertaining!,07 2023,"When I first heard about the release of ""Barbie"" in 2023, I must admit I didn't have high expectations. After all, it's a movie based on a doll beloved by generations of young girls, and I wasn't sure how that would translate into a compelling cinematic experience. However, I was in for a pleasant surprise!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Wow just wow,07 2023,"I saw this movie opening night and my expectations were beyond met and exceeded the limitations of what I thought a good movie was. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was moved completely and entirely. I laughed, I cried, and I left the movie changed. It is a masterpiece. For those who don't understand, I highly recommend watching the movie again. The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie. My favorite part of the movie was not ONLY the movie itself but the effect it is having on the communities surrounding it. The collective unspoken rule of dressing up to go see this movie. Brilliant.",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,Ryan gosling is the best part of this movie,07 2023,"This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,literally perfect,07 2023,"It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,"Surprises You, Entertains You",07 2023,"One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start. Later, as we all settle into the Barbie world, it slides in Feministic conversations. At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,perfect.,08 2023,"Everything was just so perfect. The cast, margot robbie is basically my fav person and ryan is also nice.. ig. I love how they added some actors from sex education like emma, connor and ncuti. The design was unbelievably perfect as well, the soundtrack, THE MESSAGE, EVERYTHING. I JUST LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH. It felt relatable, felt so many kinds of emotions at once which was an amazing and unique experience. LOVED IT GRETA AND MARGOT DID SO WELL!! I also loved how there were so many kinds of barbie's, like transgender barbie, allan which i think is non-binary and more.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Hilarious and Thoughtful,07 2023,"This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Surprisingly well-layered,08 2023,"Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept. Borrowing elements from the Chanel's haute couture collection, to some of the rarest outfits from Barbie, it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art; even the extras/minor characters were wearing beautiful pieces. Some of the best costume design I've seen over the years.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,An Extremely Clever and Entertaining Experience,07 2023,"Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,beautiful movie,07 2023,"I believe that everyone who said it was preachy just doesn't get it, the joy and pain this movie brought me makes it such a wonderful piece of art. The pacing of the movie was excellent as well. I never found myself checking the time waiting for it to end, i was engaged throughout. The comedy in the movie is very well done it felt fresh and not coming across as trying to hard. For me the best part was the end, that beautiful montage of women the cast and crew submitted to remind us that these women are all around us everyday and that we need to love eachother most of all. I will definitely watch it again.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Surpassed My Expectations,07 2023,"I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Strange but it has its positives,07 2023,"Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.",POSITIVE,1,0
4/10,"Enjoy the movie, feminists!",07 2023,"Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell ""the message"". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Nothing short of brilliant - could be a game-changer,07 2023,"Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.",POSITIVE,1,0
2/10,Not for me.,07 2023,"I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,It was worth it.,07 2023,"My childhood was spent with Barbie, Barbie's films and dolls, bag, clothes and notebook...and now I'm so happy and grateful. Watching this movie tooks me back to my sweet childhood memories. Everything was that I expected. Pink world and lots of beautiful Barbie's and handsome Ken's gathered together. And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play! Then one of my childhood dreams that was Barbie in the real world came true and it was interesting to me... How wonderful it is that Margot Robbie was chosen to perform this role.. She did it perfectly.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Great potential but messy closure,07 2023,"Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie,07 2023,"This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Ken out of 10,08 2023,"Barbie exceeds all expectations, delivering a self-aware and meta comedy that appeals to both devoted fans and newcomers. The film's profound layers and sharp humor create an immensely satisfying experience, showcasing the best version of Barbie on a grand scale while embracing its wonderfully weird and unique qualities.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,It's not what I expected but in a good way,07 2023,"The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of : 1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂 2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch 3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world 4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏 5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,Unexpected but so enjoyable,07 2023,"This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,"Should've been great, but is forced, not subtle or clever, and constantly repeats the same messages non-stop.",08 2023,"What a damn shame. A PG-13 Barbie movie from Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, intended for those who loved and hated Barbie. I was looking forward to seeing Barbie. However, even those who hated Barbie would not call her fascist. This film borrows from so many films, The Truman Show, The Lego Movie, Legally Blonde, Toy Story 1-3, Singing In The Rain, Born Yesterday, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, and so many more. Other films which I could not help but recall how they got it right, where this film did not.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
7/10,Much Deeper Than I Thought,07 2023,"Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
6/10,Bizarrely entertaining,07 2023,"This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,So unexpected and so good.,07 2023,"I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,"Wonderfull setup, with a not so wonderfully excecuted message",07 2023,"The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Cinematic Masterpiece,07 2023,"The entire film I was thinking ""Literally me."" It is a perfect movie in every way, the choreography was absolutely stunning it was fantastic. This movie beats out Oppenheimer in every way possible, me and the boys pulled up to Barbie excited! Will Ferrell was pretty good too as well as all the actors. The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes. Also the best part I have to say is at the very end the Barbie song by Ice Spice it slapped I had to watch the credits just to listen to the song. 10/10 would recommend. This film was perfect in every way down to each and every frame.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Best movie of the year!!,08 2023,"There is literally nothing to not love about this movie. Timing, perfect. Comedy, perfect. Ryan Gosling? Also perfect. Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie or purchase it when it comes out. It's rare to see something that synthesizes nostalgia, the societal journey of growing up (that extends generations) and balances this with comedy. There is a reason this debuted so highly at the box office and I am certain this will solidify itself as a cultural centerpiece for film schools in the future. Not only does it highlight long existing issues that half of the population has to endure, it does so in a way that you feel seen and can see others.",POSITIVE,1,0
6/10,Coming away a bit disappointed :/,08 2023,"I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Pretty Pink,07 2023,"Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.",POSITIVE,1,0
7/10,"Unfortunately, the capital B applies only to the title; otherwise it is just a C.",08 2023,"A difficult film to place. While it succeeds in entertaining and snatching a few healthy laughs-with quotes and jokes aimed mostly at an adept audience-it fails in my humble opinion in its underlying intention to convey a moral. The takeaways of the various Barbies, the monologues of the protoganist and her co-star are, in some ways, not only as anachronistic as they are predictable but all in all incomplete in their conclusions.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
3/10,"Men are trash, but now make it pink",07 2023,"Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I'm certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera's infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

10/10,For the whole family,07 2023,"Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again. So do I because I think I will find deeper concepts on a 2nd watch. And the music was phenomenal!",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Let down by all the hype,08 2023,"Not a fan. Went in with fairly high expectations but was let down by the emptiness of it all. Sure, it has a solid message of empowerment of women but why is it so boring? Will Farrell was visibly strained trying to make something of his underwritten and unfunny part. Margo Robbie didn't have enough to do for much of the film. Only Ryan Gosling had a complete character arc. I had two central problems: first, I had no idea this was such an infomercial for Mattel which never fails to get their logo into nearly every frame, even during the end credits. If someone in the company had written the first draft, I would have believed it. Second, the ""rules"" of this made-up world were vague and constantly changing. The filmmakers ripped off Wes Anderson's settings but didn't comprehend the unity in his designs, stories, and performances. Wes Anderson always feels like he's about to break the fourth wall but never does. ""Barbie"" kept breaking it over and over so that it was near impossible to fully immerse yourself in its world. I'm glad for a female director to now be empowered, but I would have liked to see a much more coherent vision.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Easily a 10/10,07 2023,"This movie is an easy 10/10 for me, did not disappoint. The casting, the directing, the plot, the cinematography, the sets, the detail, the acting, the jokes, it was all perfect. I want to rewatch this movie already! I watched it with my family and it is definitely enjoyable for everyone, the kids might not understand the movie as much but my sibling still really enjoyed it. This movie made me laugh and cry, it focuses on womanhood and mother daughter relationships in both a light hearted and sad way. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie whatsoever, absolutely loved it and recommend.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,<3,07 2023,"LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Loved every second of it,08 2023,"Grandiose movie: colourful, lovingly staged, entertaining, definitely strange but never trashy. The actors are brilliant, the dialogue to the point and the set design fantastic. It had everything: I laughed, I was thoughtful, I cried. My husband was also thrilled. Great cinema has been achieved here, from which everyone can certainly take something away, whether they are Barbie fans or not. I was excited to see the film because of the director and for me Greta Gerwig's masterful skills have been confirmed. Thank you for 114 minutes of escapism without ever losing sight of reality. For me, the best film so far in 2023.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,So much fun,07 2023,"I went and saw this with one of my best friends and it was a quite ride. We laughed, we cried, we had a great time! Barbie was definitely one of the best films we've seen all year! This was relatable on so many levels! I personally felt that there really is something in this movie for everybody! It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well! The entire cast was absolutely incredible in making this film both be true to what Barbie is to little girls and what it did for children growing up!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Pleasantly surprised,08 2023,"I went to see this movie after hearing all kinds of ""propaganda"" about it so I wasn't sure what to expect. I absolutely loved it! It was hilarious, thought provoking, inspirational, and an all around great movie. Definitely geared towards adults but the jokes that may be mildly inappropriate (and I do mean MILDLY) will go over kids' heads. I loved seeing the character arcs and how each of them grew and changed ultimately for the better by the end of the film. While I was I initially hesitant to go and see it I loved it and would absolutely watch again. I recommend this movie whether you love Barbie or have mixed feelings.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,People are missing the point,08 2023,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top.

4/10,Extremely OVER HYPED,07 2023,"Definitely not understanding why this movie was over hyped. What age demographic is this movie for exactly? It's not a movie for little kids. Maybe pre teen girls? And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Hi Barbie!,07 2023,"Greta Garwig is a pretty interesting filmmaker as her previous works on ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were pretty good. Here, ""Barbie"" is really wild but I had a really fun time watching it. Throughout, the colorful pink designs, models, background, settings and structures were pretty good as it helps add the film's purposeful tone and atmosphere all together. Written by Noah Baumbach, the narrative is pretty good as it's clear the film doesn't take itself seriously and explores some pretty interesting satirical themes that worked well together with the story. All the performances were pretty good especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as they have pretty great chemistry with one another. The characters were really fun to watch as it was fun to see all the Barbies, Kens, Allen, and the real world characters interact and perform on the screen.",POSITIVE,1,0

The plot and message was unexpected, in a good way though. I could also tell that it touched people. In the theatre, I heard "" oh my god,"", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, "" Oh this movie is sexist against men,"". You really have to see the movie to understand it.

I hope the success of this movie leads to more films directed by, starring, and made for women. Hollywood has spent far too long catering to men, I see a cultural shift in the next few years. Women want good movies too, with strong, well developed, independent female characters that don't rely on men to interact with one another. Looking forward to more movies like Barbie.",POSITIVE,1,0

Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera's ""Allan"" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,More depth than expected from the previews,09 2023,"I really liked the movie. Without going into too much detail, I was surprised when I realized the movie was made more for us who played with the Barbies way back in the day. You think it's directed at the younger generations but it actually fits since even my own daughter never wanted nor played with a Barbie. I myself had the entire entourage,(and still have them, almost 40 years later) so it was much more endearing and relatable. I liked the underlying themes, which added depth and perspective that I didn't expect at all. I think that taking very complex and deep topics about societal issues and trying to keep them light is quite often better than delving too deep into these topics . It gives people a chance to think, feel and relate to it, without having the movie become too heavy, or being 'too much'. People that thought it was confusing probably didn't understand that the movie intended to keep it lighthearted for this very reason. I recommend seeing it, especially if you have a Barbie still tucked away on your closet, too.",POSITIVE,1,0

The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify.

1/10,"Failed to be funny, failed to be exciting",08 2023,"It was one of the worst movies I've seen. I just tolerated it because I was with my family otherwise would leave the theater. Jokes were not funny. The message were poorly articulated. Nothing exciting except the decorations. It significantly lacks depth and can perpetuate certain stereotypes or unrealistic beauty standards. However, opinions on the movies vary, and some viewers enjoy them for their entertainment value and positive messages. It ultimately depends on personal preferences and perspectives. To me it was not funny, nor entertaining. It is a waste of time. No wonder many watchers left.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,The most fun I've had at the movies in AGES!,07 2023,"I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was everything I could have ever wanted it to be and THEN SOME! Fun, empowering, intelligent, socially relevant, deeply moving and by far the pinkest movie l've ever seen! An all around an amazing experience and there's something in it for everyone! All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in. Amazing cast, excellent cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, you definitely want to see this one!",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,Definitely Not For Kids,07 2023,"I've just taken 2 nieces, 9 and 14, to see Barbie. They both hated it... really, really hated it!! And, me: I'm just stunned. I've no idea what I've just seen.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,Exactly what it should be,07 2023,"Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Perfection,07 2023,"The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.",POSITIVE,1,0
1/10,A plastic product.,07 2023,"I thought the first half of the movie was hilarious and well done, but the last act of the movie is where it lost me. Instead of trying to communicate a message, it really felt like it was preaching way too much. Instead of showing, it tells you what to think in the last act of the movie.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Movie of the year!!!,07 2023,"I Love this one so much!! Movie of the year!!! Most men here will criticize and give it a bad grade, but you have no idea how much a film like this can touch the heart of every mother, daughter and girl who loves Barbie dolls in the whole world, it is moving to watch all of this, besides that final scene only serves to show the struggle that women have always suffered their whole lives and that their daughters and those who will come in the future will suffer. A film that sends such an important message is extremely important to us. I laughed and cried so much, was such a lovely experience, i wish i could watch again but this time with my mom.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Amazing. Gorgeous. Stunning. Depressing.,07 2023,"This is the first movie I've ever watched that I cannot stop thinking about. The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,"On surface an 8, underneath a 10",07 2023,"Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,A hysterically funny and clever triumph from Gerwig,07 2023,"In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that. The film's jokes come rapid-fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way, even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film-related references that cinephiles will adore.",POSITIVE,1,0
2/10,A Missed Opportunity for Empowerment,09 2023,"Barbie 2023 had the potential to be an empowering film, but it ultimately fell short of its promise. While the actors' performances were commendable, the overall message conveyed by the movie was misleading. Instead of celebrating feminine power, it seemed to portray a narrative of feminine revenge and hostility towards men. This approach left little room for nuanced exploration of gender dynamics and empowerment.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
4/10,Barbie in two words: Stereotypical. Cliche.,07 2023,"Outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline. Gosling once again shows that he's in a class of his own. Barbie started out fun but shortly into the film, the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse. The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well. Seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Barbie (2023) Greta Gerwig creates a magical world,07 2023,"Barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the year 2023. Many people made fun of him believing that he would be lame, and other people believed that he could actually be very good because of the cast and direction. Is it rough? In a way yes. But it's deliberately lame, they're living puppets, it's obvious that this is lame. The big complaint about the film is about the critics, as many people found it exaggerated and indeed it is, but again, it's on purpose. The criticism works very well, the characters work, the universe built here is incredible. Visually it is one of the most beautiful films of the year, a world all pink could be very strange, but it turned out beautiful and very convincing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are very good and manage to hold your attention, on the other hand, when they try to focus on other characters, the quality is not the same. Some characters don't work, particularly the businessmen who are featured in real life. Overall, this film is great and has earned its place among the best and most memorable films of 2023.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Thank you,07 2023,"Thank you for this movie ! It's beautiful by the décor, costumes and music, but so much more beautiful with the message. We do need that kind of movie in our world.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Barbie the Movie is awesome,07 2023,"I didn't have a lot of big expectations for this movie, so imagine how happy and surprised I was about how much I enjoyed it! It's silly, and fun and then BOOM- existentialism! While I wouldn't recommend this movie for under 10- there's A LOT of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads, but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles, IMO. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect! Margot Robbie is a delight, as is Ryan Gosling. The entire cast is wonderful! Issa Rae never disappoints and her role as President Barbie! A truly fun summer movie!",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,"Genuinely funny movie, with problems",08 2023,"A fun experience leading up to Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" was, of course, the marketing campaign and the internet excitement leading up to the film. To me, the success of the movie is so fun since everyone, at least where I am from, was so excited to see it. Thankfully, it think it was worth it. The film succeeds on some levels, most particularly the comedy, performances, and production design. The soundtrack with countless artists and produced by Mark Robson is very fitting as well.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,She's more than just barbie!,07 2023,"The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,"against the odds its a very good movie, not only for children",07 2023,"I went into the theatre thinking this is gonna be a little girls movie, about dolls and weird stuff. I thought it was gonna be a boring almost 2h movie about dolls, but oh boy was I wrong.not only was the theatre almost full on the third day of it airing, it was also: funny, inspiring, sad, and at times pretty confusing. It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting In conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Greta Gerwig Makes A Perfect Movie,07 2023,"I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like ""the greatest weekend in cinema"", ""Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again"", ""Barbie wins the weekend""... But this is so much more than that.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Not what I expected,08 2023,"Originally when I went into the cinema my expectations were quite low however I was pleasantly surprised. Everything from the set, the dances, the music, the costumes and the actors were phenomenal. Credit to Ryan Gosling, he fulfilled his role as Ken so well and his interactions with Margot Robbie were top notch. I loved the amount of secret cameos that went into when making this movie. This piece of media will go down in history as it has been so well done and the message(s) in it were very much prevalent. I couldn't be happier, I adore this movie and I cannot wait to watch it again at home.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Absurdist Feminist Masterpiece,07 2023,"With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Heartwarming Mother and Daughter movie,07 2023,"My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Barbie can be anything!,09 2023,"This movie wasn't just a plastic fantastic teenage movie, or rather it wasn't at all plastic but rather fantastic, and was actually deep and with a ton of messages and pointers about being a daughter, a mother, a Woman, a human being . I laughed at times, was blown away at times because it really mastered the sparkle and magic of the universe of Barbie, but I was also touched to tears at time- and I left the cinema with a feeling of having seen something important. A thing I actually hadn't expected. This is not just a movie about Barbies, but a movie about starting life with dreams, expectations, innocence, naïveté and how those things just doesn't always match reality- it's about making choices of who we want to be/ not wanting to be. Barbie can be anything (poor Ken is just Ken- a really relatable feeling being a woman living in a man's world)- do we want to be the product or do we want to make an impact of the product?",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Loved It!,07 2023,"Barbie is definitely one of the best films to bought out to cinemas this year, or even longer than that. It had us laughing from the start to finish, crying in some moments and scenes so overall it was an emotional rollercoaster. Greta has done a great job and balanced a mix of fun and hard truths about the world we live in today. For people say this isn't worth watching, clearly don't know how to let a film just transport you away into its world for a moment, absolutely brilliant film, I'd pay to go and watch it again. Well done to Greta, Margot, Ryan and all of the cast & crew for a fantastic watch!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,screaming crying throwing up,07 2023,"This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,BARBIENHEIMER,09 2023,"I did not have incredibly high expectations for the lengths that some may have felt this film will go into, maybe because of it being sided with Nolan's Oppenheimer, but you should maybe your readjust your expectations a bit before going into this to enjoy the full experience. What I mean is that there are hints of the graceful indie style of directing Gerwig presented in her previous works, but it is mostly set up as a blockbuster comedy, but one that is still really enjoyable.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Not for me,09 2023,"If you are a girl and under 12 definitely go watch this movie. If you are anything else read my review: Not sure what i was expecting before, but I was clearly disappointed in the plot. A boring start with some interesting moments during the middle, and a super boring ending. Maybe the visuals were indeed nice, but thats not enough or at least should not be. Margot is indeed worthy of the role, great acting, for that reason the 5 stars are more than enough. Glad that I did not pay for the advertisements and the propaganda ;) So in order to summarise, its not something i would recommend , the rating is over buffed, and the 2 hours of the movie is way too much.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,what an amazing movie,07 2023,"More could you want from a movie? How about Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Hari Nef all playing Barbie variations, like Weird Barbie, President Barbie, and Doctor Barbie. Plus, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and Ncuti Gatwa are all playing Kens. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the company who first brought us Barbie and her Dreamhouse. The film focuses on what happens when the perfect doll has an existential crisis, and Mattel's pursuit to stop Barbie from changing the real world forever. Greta Gerwig ('Lady Bird') directs a script she co-wrote with partner and fellow filmmaker Noah Baumbach ('Marriage Story'). Drop by the Dreamhouse in your pink convertible when the movie premieres in July 2023.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,A shrewd satire?,07 2023,"Is Barbie a shrewd satire? Despite the existence of two divided factions, in this case, men versus women, which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether Barbie's message is ""correct"" or not, the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences. The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in today's society, as they inevitably generate controversy.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Fun for some and Kenough for others,07 2023,"This film has certainly grabbed the headlines and produced some very positive reviews which encouraged us to see for ourselves. We were a little disapointed in the end. Whilst it was watchable and had it's humerous moments, we somehow expected more from it. It's very much in the mould of a Hollywood film with lots of obvious cliches. There were quite a few teenage girls in the cinema with their mothers, which could be the ones who enjoy this film the most. It's been described as a 'fun' film by many, which I can understand. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their parts well and add to the charm of the film. I would hesitate to recommend this, other than to youngsters or 'young at hearts' who love Barbie dolls and want see a fun film with lots of pink sparkle.",POSITIVE,1,0
1/10,"Marketing con, the worst film I've seen in years",08 2023,"A word of advice. Don't waste your money and time going to see the Barbie movie. Went with the whole family (including my 12 year old daughter and wife) and they asked to leave before it was over, it was that bad. I think it's been 30 years since I walked out of a movie theater because the movie was so, so bad. I don't know how it's been so successful. Marketing at its best (or worst). It's boring, disjointed, and sexist (to both men and women). It's an unwatchable mess, and by the last 20 minutes we cared so little about the characters, that we just left. It's horrendous. Save two hours of your life and don't bother watching.",NEGATIVE,-1,1

The casting was on point, the sets are eye catching, the soundtrack is delectable! I can not express how much this movie has impacted my life. After seeing it not once, not twice, but three times it gets better and better every time. This movie is so hilarious while also being profound and thought-provoking. I left the theater crying all 3 times, each time shedding more tears than the last. Watching it with my mother was truly a special experience as I got to see how the themes of the movies impacted her as well. I think about this quote at least once a day,"" Mothers stand still so their daughters can look back and see how far they've come."" I would recommend the Barbie Movie to anyone and everyone!",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,One of a kind movie,07 2023,"Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor.

1/10,Terribble,09 2023,"The Barbie movie is a film that fails to captivate its audience.

10/10,Such a fun time for people not stuck in the 1950's,07 2023,"Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more. I can't believe a movie like this got such a huge budget and is such a success.",POSITIVE,1,0

Yesterday, I saw the movie. It was so great, just so great, My God. Ken is just it. He is just it. Kenough said. You Just Need to buy a ticket, or two and go See it. Some people might Not understand the Movie, maybe your friends or family sitting next to you dont like it. But that is okay. Because you Just wittnessed something special, a historic moment in movie history and you felt it. You know it for sure. And then Barbie ends and all you want to do is Watch it again. Thank you for Making this movie. I will treasure it forever. Thank you, it was so much fun. This is the kend of My Review.",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,Really Disappointed,09 2023,"Was very much looking forward to this movie. It's, unfortunately, terribly written. They needed to figure out how to get all the ladies who don't like Barbie on board so they went way over the top on the ""patriarchy"" at the expense of a real plot and good writing. So many cringe moments (the dancing Kens, Barbie turning into real person, the weird montage at the end) that just didn't make sense. Too bad, a good writer could have made this movie poignant, clever, funny and fun to watch. Instead, the script just pondered.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,"Amazing movie, makes you feel so many emotions!",07 2023,"This movie is absolutely amazing! It totally makes you think about the current society and what we really do prioritise and favour. Went into it without knowing what sort of angle they would take, and I was so extremely surprised and pleased with how Greta has done this. I can truthfully say I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, however there was times where tears were also shed due to the meaning of the film. Casting was a brilliant choice, Margot was the perfect fit for Barbie and Ryan a great Ken. Also want to mention that America and Kate did awesome jobs with their characters. A must watch, possibly best movie of the year!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,The magical connection between human imagination in the life of a conscious doll!,07 2023,"Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Fun Heartfelt Romp,08 2023,"I have not laughed so hard at a movie in such a lot time. There are so many tropes and explorations of what it means to be both genders, and they all just nail it.

9/10,"Great movie, great fashion, great dialog",08 2023,"I don't understand all the criticism. I thought it was great. I don't think it's too preachy, I think it's educational and smart. I feel like I learned a lot and I hope other people did too. I heard someone say that the barbie movie Barbie said so many things yet said nothing at all. Meaning it should have been bolder. But I think it said a lot. It doesn't tell you what to think but it's a reflection of the real world that we live in. I'll probably rewatch it just to hear the dialog properly. And I loved the fashion. It made me feel more confident in being a grown woman and not a baby or a teen. It's kind of grownup outfits yet it doesn't hide the fact that women wants to be pretty amd wear high heels, and that it makes them happy.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Let's go Barbie! And Ken is a Ten,07 2023,"I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,Half-baked script with an impressive budget,07 2023,"This movie LOOKED amazing. The costumes, sets, editing, and choreography were all high-budget and high-quality. That's probably why the poor writing stuck out like a sore thumb.",POSITIVE,1,0

4/10,Disappointing,08 2023,"The first half of the movie was pretty solid. Lots of tongue in cheek and fun humour. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were both very solid casting choices. Will Ferrell, was perfectly cast and hilarious as always. The portrayal of the Barbie world was very well done. The nasty shocks Barbie got when coming into the real world were also very funny. However, the movie soon descended into philosophical and political plot points which just felt weird. If it was just a bit more like Toy Story and a little less like Legally Blonde, it would have been perfect. It just took itself a bit too seriously and just laid some stuff on really thick. It's hard to know who this movie was pitched to. I would have thought it would be for families, but a lot of this would have flown right over many people's heads. It's a shame. It was a good idea, but poorly executed (as many Hollywood products have been recently).",NEUTRAL,0,2

Makes everyone feel like they have a part to play. It's a must-watch for all ages, as it beautifully brings the beloved Barbie character to life in a way that leaves a lasting impression. Don't miss out on this enjoyable and mesmerizing cinematic adventure! Also, there is nothing after the end credits.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Fun and honest,09 2023,"Although I had read varing opinions on the film, I hadn't bought into them too much as I didn't want anything to be spoiled. It isn't the standard kind of film i would watch but I found it fun, colourful and heart felt with a sad, honest but important undertone and message. I dont see how embracing Inclusivity, equality, femininity and respecting bodily and mental autonomy is a negative. I think this film will make certain people uncomfortable and easily confused as to the message it is trying to convey but I'm glad they didn't dumb it down for those particular audiences and were brave enough not to pander. My kids loved the film and it allowed for some discussion and reflection without breaking the fun vibe.",POSITIVE,1,0
9/10,Hi Barbie,09 2023,"If you're expecting a subtle satirical flick, Barbie isn't for you. However, you'll be missing out a quite beautiful and clever movie that talks about womanhood like a few movies do.",NEUTRAL,0,2
5/10,Terribly overrated claptrap.,07 2023,"In which Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach recycle their failed 30 minute Black Mirror idea and pad it out to a full two hour shaggy dog tale, of little or no consequence, whilst breaking the hearts of nine year old girls worldwide who flock in their millions to a movie that flies straight over their heads.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Come on Barbie let's go party,07 2023,"""Barbie"" may seem like an improbable concept for a thought-provoking film, but director Greta Gerwig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message. Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig's clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience.",POSITIVE,1,0
4/10,A big mess wrapped up in pink.,07 2023,"The marketing for this movie was incredible, so are actors and the whole setting. Not only does that attract a massive audience, but also seeing the famous doll many grew up with. Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can not wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can not decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might have been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,Hilarious and touching,07 2023,"The most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. The jokes are meta and hilarious. The performances all through spectacular. This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Great works do not belong to nations - they belong to all mankind,09 2023,"It is a very good movie, a great movie! The actors are great, the film's making is very good in general.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Unexpected well done societal criticism,07 2023,"Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,I've always loved BARBIE films but I love this one more!,07 2023,"So good, the emotions, the reality and how it came together as a live action BARBIE film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children. I am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding. There was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant! My favourite has to be the weird BARBIE because I definitely relate to her more! I recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh it's just a kids film but once you've watched it, it's not what you expect and I'm itchy to watch it again!",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Women are incredible,07 2023,"As someone who has been a fan of Barbie since I was a little girl, this movie was an incredible journey. The set was beautiful, the cast was great, and the soundtrack amazing. My favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively. It was achieved in a light hearted and caring way. The original hopes and dreams of Barbie's existence are brought to life, as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish. In a world which does not always cater to women's needs, this film does a great job of holding us all accountable. We now live in a post-Barbie movie era, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds.",POSITIVE,1,0
1/10,"Thanks, no!",09 2023,"The most unpleasant and disappointing film that has come out recently! To be honest, I was waiting for this movie! Because of Gosling and Robbie! I waited in vain. Boring plot, bad music (there's not even Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"" song), poor acting and general atmosphere of the film. And even though it is the highest-grossing film of the year, I didn't like it, like many others. Oppenheimer turned out to be much better, and thanks to him for that! I do not recommend this film under any circumstances. Never. Watch only good movies and don't waste time on mediocre film projects. Good luck to all! Bye!",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,Gorgeous,07 2023,"This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to ""apologize"" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.",POSITIVE,1,0
3/10,Don't take your kids to see this movie,09 2023,"""Barbie the movie"" left me disappointed and unimpressed. The storyline felt overly simplistic, lacking depth and originality. The dialogue was clichéd, often predictable, and failed to engage the audience. The characters seemed one-dimensional, and their development was superficial at best. The animation, touted as a highlight, fell short of expectations, lacking the polish and detail one would anticipate from a major production. Overall, it failed to capture the attention of both children and adults, making it a forgettable viewing experience. Even the scene with America Ferrera felt so forced and cliche and it fed on superficial emotions.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Great but not without flaws,07 2023,"This movie was an absolute hoot at my screening! A week after it's release, my theater was packed with people, laughing and clapping throughout the whole film. It was a great experience, and I really enjoyed the movie. Michael Cera was probably my favorite actor along with Ryan gosling and surprisingly Kate McKinnon. The story and adventure was really fun, I was absolutely in love with the visuals throughout the film, and I thought the self awareness was really refreshing. The music also energized the film throughout. With all that being said, I did have two complaints. The first is that the conclusion of the movie is that men and women can't work together, and I think that was a really strange choice. I understand that the movie wanted to empower independence but collaboration is also very important. Second complaint, why the heck was there a Chevrolet commercial in the middle of the movie? Anyways loved the movie and can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig does next.",POSITIVE,1,0
1/10,Did we all see the same movie?,09 2023,"I was literally praying to be struck dead so I didn't have to see one more second of this film. Even Margot Robbie couldn't save this over hyped trash. I could feel my IQ drop each minute of the movie that went by. I was amazed, shocked and in horror to see that there were actually people on IMDB none the less who thought this film was ::gasp:: good? Not even close, waste of my time and a waste of my life which I can never get back.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,The most delight movie for me,07 2023,"In this movie you can see deep meaning sense of live, you need to know just little things before or to be open mind and the whole univers will show appear for you. Most of scenes have a hidden or deep mening, i am not going to write too much about movie because i am here to sustain Greta Gerwing and i am very grateful for her because she had the creep to made it. Maybe more director will do movies for our souls not just for action,adventure,etc...",POSITIVE,1,0
1/10,One of the worse movies I've seen in the last decade,09 2023,"Barbie is a film that left me thoroughly disappointed from the very first scene to the closing credits. The film's overall execution was subpar, and there were a few elements, in particular, that stood out as particularly frustrating. Firstly, the storyline felt disjointed and lacked depth. It failed to engage the audience or maybe it did but it went nowhere with it, making it difficult to invest in the characters or their journey. The pacing was inconsistent, causing the narrative to drag at times and rush through critical moments at others. Secondly, the two lead characters, lacked the charisma and development necessary to carry the message of the film. Their interactions often felt forced and devoid of chemistry, making it challenging to root for their relationship. Overall, Barbie fell short of expectations in terms of plot, character development, and engagement. It left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and regret for investing my time in this cinematic endeavor I regret inviting my friends to watch it. It could have been a movie with a great message. This film, unfortunately, missed the mark on delivering an enjoyable and memorable experience.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,Surprisingly great,08 2023,"I had to watch this movie twice. The first time, we missed the first 5 minutes, and the whole movie was confusing and I left feeling bewildered and disappointed. Then I read a review by Michael Knowles, and I realized I missed something very crucial at the start. My teenaged daughter and I went back, and we watch it from the beginning. This is a very clever movie. The layers of cleverness become very apparent when you look beyond the surface. It is a story of current society- and the ills that plague us.",POSITIVE,1,0
8/10,Dumb Fun,07 2023,"First, lower your expectations and second, this is not a children's movie. Lastly, don't take it seriously.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
5/10,I Expected it to be a Lot Better,08 2023,"In Barbie, there are things that deserve praise. But at the same time, there are a lot of things that deserve criticism.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
8/10,Incredibly fun & easily profound,07 2023,"I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Great movie! Plot issues..but it's a movie about barbies,07 2023,"""Barbie,"" the film, is an enchanting cinematic experience that is sure to entertain viewers of all ages. It's a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,You don't have to love Barbies to love this movie and identify with it,07 2023,"I'm not a Barbie fan girl in the least, but I think this has become one of those movies I will cherish. Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them ""weak"" or ""stupid"" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
9/10,A Fun Summer Box Office,08 2023,"As one of the most anticipated films of the year, Barbie has managed to meet all audience expectations -especially cinephiles - and make it the most daring film of the year. Director Greta Gerwig (supported by screenwriter Noah Baumbach) doesn't just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon: colorful set designs, stunning costumes and make-up, great music (they all sing!), the history of the Barbie doll, but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism, patriarchy, feminism, diversity, inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense. As a film, Barbie delivers it all: fun, excitement and seriousness. The casting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken is also the right choice. Barbie reminds us again that summer box office hits can be really fun and good.",POSITIVE,1,0
5/10,hot pink cotton candy mess,07 2023,"Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.",NEGATIVE,-1,1
10/10,What a delightful surprise!,09 2023,"I was hesitant when I put it on but WOW! I never imagined it'd be as good as it is! The acting was on point, beautiful sets, and an amazing storyline & plot! 👏 when I first attempted to watch it, I thought it wouldn't be worth much so I was doing other things, caught myself several times stopping to watch until I finally paused it, finished what I was doing and sat down to watch it from the beginning and I'm so glad I did. I've already recommended it to my friends. Glad I was able to take advantage of Amazon having it to purchase as I hate movie theaters. So it worked out well being as I can now watch it whenever I like. Which I'm sure will be often.",POSITIVE,1,0
10/10,Meaningful and interesting movie😋,07 2023,"Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw ""Let me show you"" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.",POSITIVE,1,0
